The 327 readmissions, including 42 patients who were readmitted more than once during the study period, accounted for 12% of medical admissions. Nearly 75% of readmissions were due to previously diagnosed medical conditions; complications of drugs or therapeutic procedures caused 29%, and patient compliance contributed to 11%. Three reviewers judged 28 (9%) readmissions to be potentially preventable. These 28 readmissions constituted 1% of all admissions to the medical service and did not result in any fatalities, indicating that the quality of care was generally very good. One third of the potentially preventable readmissions were thought to be related to medical system failures, one third to an unfulfilled hope that the patient would improve after discharge, and one third to other suboptimal judgements in evaluation or treatment. Of the 28 potentially preventable readmissions, 89% occurred within 10 days of discharge. We conclude that potentially preventable readmissions would nearly always be detected by review of readmissions within 10 days of discharge and that many may be amenable to systematic interventions such as standardized predischarge assessment and better coordination of post-discharge follow-up.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sibbritt, D W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Validation of a 28 day interval between discharge and readmission for emergency readmission rates.</title><secondary-title>Journal of quality in clinical practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of quality in clinical practice</full-title></periodical><pages>211-220 10p</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Acute Disease</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Child</keyword><keyword>Emergency Service</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Health Status Indicators</keyword><keyword>Hospital</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Medicine</keyword><keyword>Models</keyword><keyword>New South Wales</keyword><keyword>Outcome Assessment (Health Care)</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Specialization</keyword><keyword>Theoretical</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>utilization</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1995</year></dates><pub-location>University of Newcastle, Department of Statistics, Health Services Research Group, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia</pub-location><publisher>Wiley-Blackwell</publisher><accession-num>8719060</accession-num><notes>From Duplicate 2 (Validation of a 28 day interval between discharge and readmission for emergency readmission rates. - Sibbritt, D W)

This time period, however, has rarely been justified clinically or statistically and certainly not in Australia. In examining the patterns of readmissions to NSW public acute hospitals, this study provides statistical support for the use of a 28 day interval for total readmissions.

DESIGN: The instrument was developed in two phases. Phase 1 was a prospective comparison of admitting residents' and their attending physicians' classifications of the perceived preventability of consecutive admissions to one Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) excluding admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU). In phase 2, a panel of 10 physicians rated 811 abstracted records of readmissions from nine VAMCs. SETTING: Nine VAMCs across the United States with varying degrees of university hospital affiliation. PATIENTS: Phase 1, 156 patients admitted to the general medicine service at the Durham VAMC. Phase 2, 514 patients accounting for 811 readmissions within 6 months of a general medicine service discharge at nine VAMCs. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Physicians used a checklist to record the reason for hospitalization, the preventability of the hospitalization, and, if preventable, a reason defining preventability, which was classified in terms of system, clinician, and patient factors. In phase 2, two physician panelists assessed preventability for each chart. When two panelists disagreed on the preventability of hospitalization, a third panelist, blind to the original assessments, rated the chart. In phase 1, residents and attending physicians rated 33% and 34% of admissions as preventable (kappa = 0.41), respectively. In phase 2, 277 (34%) of 811 readmissions were deemed preventable. Intraobserver accuracy for the assessment of preventability was 96% (kappa = 0.89). interobserver accuracy was 73% (kappa = 0.43). Hospital system factors accounted for 37% of preventable readmissions, clinician factors for 38%, and patient factors for 21%. The nine hospitals differed markedly in their profile of reasons for preventable readmissions (p = .005). CONCLUSIONS: Using a new method of determining the preventability of hospitalizations, we identified several factors that might avert hospitalizations. Focusing efforts to identify preventable hospitalizations may yield better methods for managing patients' total health care needs; however, the content of those efforts will vary by institution.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Halfon, Patricia</author><author>Eggli, Yves</author><author>van Melle, Guy</author><author>Chevalier, Julia</author><author>Wasserfallen, Jean Blaise</author><author>Burnand, Bernard</author><author>P., Halfon</author><author>Y., Eggli</author><author>G., Van Melle</author><author>J., Chevalier</author><author>J.-B., Wasserfallen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Measuring potentially avoidable hospital readmissions</title><secondary-title>Journal of Clinical Epidemiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Clinical Epidemiology</full-title></periodical><pages>573-587</pages><volume>55</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>80 and over</keyword><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Algorithms</keyword><keyword>Analysis of Variance</keyword><keyword>Child</keyword><keyword>Computerized</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis-Related Groups</keyword><keyword>Health Services Misuse</keyword><keyword>Hospitals</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Infant</keyword><keyword>Medical Records Systems</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care)</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Preschool</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Sensitivity and Specificity</keyword><keyword>Switzerland</keyword><keyword>University</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>standards</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>utilization</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><pub-location>P.

We studied hospital information system data of a random sample of 3,474 inpatients discharged alive in 1997 from a university hospital and medical records of those (1,115) readmitted within 1 year. The gold standard was set on the basis of the hospital data and medical records: all readmissions were classified as foreseen readmissions, unforeseen readmissions for a new affection, or unforeseen readmissions for a previously known affection. The latter category was submitted to a systematic medical record review to identify the main cause of readmission. Potentially avoidable readmissions were defined as a subgroup of unforeseen readmissions for a previously known affection occurring within an appropriate interval, set to maximize the chance of detecting avoidable readmissions. The computerized screening algorithm was strictly based on routine statistics: diagnosis and procedures coding and admission mode. The prediction was based on a Poisson regression model. There were 454 (13.1%) unforeseen readmissions for a previously known affection within 1 year. Fifty-nine readmissions (1.7%) were judged avoidable, most of them occurring within 1 month, which was the interval used to define potentially avoidable readmissions (n = 174, 5.0%). The intra-sample sensitivity and specificity of the screening algorithm both reached approximately 96%. Higher risk for potentially avoidable readmission was associated with previous hospitalizations, high comorbidity index, and long length of stay; lower risk was associated with surgery and delivery. The model offers satisfactory predictive performance and a good medical plausibility. The proposed measure could be used as an indicator of inpatient care outcome. However, the instrument should be validated using other sets of data from various hospitals. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

However, most commonly used measures raise conceptual issues. OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate the usefulness of the computerized algorithm for identifying avoidable readmissions on the basis of minimum bias, criterion validity, and measurement precision. RESEARCH DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: A total of 131,809 hospitalizations of patients discharged alive from 49 hospitals were used to compare the predictive performance of risk adjustment methods. A subset of a random sample of 570 medical records of discharge/readmission pairs in 12 hospitals were reviewed to estimate the predictive value of the screening of potentially avoidable readmissions. MEASURES: Potentially avoidable readmissions, defined as readmissions related to a condition of the previous hospitalization and not expected as part of a program of care and occurring within 30 days after the previous discharge, were identified by a computerized algorithm. Unavoidable readmissions were considered as censored events. RESULTS: A total of 5.2% of hospitalizations were followed by a potentially avoidable readmission, 17% of them in a different hospital. The predictive value of the screen was 78%; 27% of screened readmissions were judged clearly avoidable. The correlation between the hospital rate of clearly avoidable readmission and all readmissions rate, potentially avoidable readmissions rate or the ratio of observed to expected readmissions were respectively 0.42, 0.56 and 0.66. Adjustment models using clinical information performed better. CONCLUSION: Adjusted rates of potentially avoidable readmissions are scientifically sound enough to warrant their inclusion in hospital quality surveillance. © 2006 Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, Inc.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ruiz, Borja</author><author>Garcia, Montserrat</author><author>Aguirre, Urko</author><author>Aguirre, Carmelo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Factors predicting hospital readmissions related to adverse drug reactions</title><secondary-title>European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European Journal of Clinical Pharmacology</full-title></periodical><pages>715-722</pages><volume>64</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions</keyword><keyword>Hospitalization</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><pub-location>C.

METHODS: This was a case-control study in which unscheduled admissions of patients who had been admitted to the hospital during the two previous months were assessed during a 21-month period. The patient was considered a case when the main diagnosis of readmission complied with the World Health Organisation's definition of an ADR. For each case, two controls were selected from those patients that had been admitted for ADR without readmission (n = 177). Information on drugs and other risk factors was obtained from cases by interview and from controls by clinical record review. RESULTS: There were 26,559 unscheduled admissions of which 81 were readmissions associated with ADR (4.5% of the unscheduled readmissions). There were no statistically significant correlations with sex, age or medical history, with the exception of arterial hypertension. The main drug products causing readmission were acenocoumarol (15, 18.5%), antihypertensive-diuretics (14, 17.3%), anticancer drugs (11, 13.6%) and digoxin (seven, 8.6%). In the multivariate logistic analysis, the variables predicting readmission were acenocoumarol [odds ratio (OR) 12.2, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.8-38.3, P &lt; 0.0001], a record of diabetes mellitus (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.3-5.5, P &lt; 0.01), the number of drugs taken at the moment of ADR (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1-1.4, P &lt; 0.001) and high blood pressure (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.6, P &lt; 0.001) even though the latter was a negative predictor, preventing readmission. Of the 81 readmissions associated with ADR, 28 (34.6%) were preventable. CONCLUSION: A medical record of diabetes mellitus, polypharmacy and acenocoumarol treatment were risk factors predicting hospital readmission related to ADR.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Demir, Eren</author><author>Chaussalet, Thierry J</author><author>Xie, Haifeng</author><author>Millard, Peter H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Emergency readmission criterion: a technique for determining the emergency readmission time window</title><secondary-title>IEEE transactions on information technology in biomedicine : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE transactions on information technology in biomedicine : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society</full-title></periodical><pages>644-649</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Chronic Obstructive</keyword><keyword>Emergency Service</keyword><keyword>England</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Hospital</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Length of Stay</keyword><keyword>Outcome Assessment (Health Care)</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Disease</keyword><keyword>Recurrence</keyword><keyword>Risk Assessment</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Stroke</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><pub-location>E.

Yet in the literature, shorter and longer periods such as 14 days or 90-180 days have also been suggested. In this paper, we develop a modeling approach that systematically tackles the issue surrounding the appropriate choice of a time window as a definition of readmission. The approach is based on the intuitive idea that patients who are discharged from hospital can be broadly divided in to two groups-a group that is at high risk of readmission and a group that is at low risk. Using the national data (England), we demonstrate the usefulness of the approach in the case of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, and congestive heart failure (CHF) patients, which are known to be the leading causes of early readmission. Our findings suggest that there are marked differences in the optimal width of the time window for COPD, stroke, and CHF patients. Furthermore, time windows and the probabilities of being in the high-risk group for COPD, stroke, and CHF patients for each of the 29 acute and specialist trusts in the London area indicate wide variability between hospitals. The novelty of this modeling approach lies in its ability to define an appropriate time window based on evidence objectively derived from operational data. Therefore, it can separately provide a unique approach in examining variability between hospitals, and potentially contribute to a better definition of readmission as a performance indicator.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Balla, Uri</author><author>Malnick, Stephen</author><author>Schattner, Ami</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Early readmissions to the department of medicine as a screening tool for monitoring quality of care problems.</title><secondary-title>Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>294-300</pages><volume>87</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Israel</keyword><keyword>Length of Stay</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mass Screening</keyword><keyword>Patient Discharge</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Quality of Health Care</keyword><keyword>Single-Blind Method</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><pub-location>A.

We examined the utility of hospital readmissions for this purpose in a prospective case-control study in a large academic medical center in Israel. All patients with nonelective readmissions to 2 departments of medicine within 30 days of discharge were interviewed, and their medical records were carefully examined with emphasis on the index admission. Patient data were compared to data for age- and sex-matched controls (n = 140) who were not readmitted. Medical records of readmitted and control patients were blindly evaluated by 2 senior clinicians who independently identified potential quality of care (QOC) problems during the index admission. Inhospital and late mortality was determined 6 months after discharge.Over a period of 3 months there were 1988 urgent admissions; 1913 discharges and subsequently 271 unplanned readmissions occurred (14.1% of discharges). Readmissions occurred an average of 10 days after discharge, and readmitted patients were sicker than controls (mean, 4.3 vs. 3.3 diagnoses per patient), although their length of stay was similarly short (3.4 +/- 2.8 d). Analysis of all readmissions revealed QOC problems in 90/271 (33%) of readmissions, 4.5% of hospitalizations. All were deemed preventable. Interobserver agreement was good (83%, kappa = 0.67). Among matched controls, only 8/140 admissions revealed QOC problems (6%, p &lt; 0.001) (k = 0.77). The preventable readmissions mostly involved a vascular event or congestive heart failure; they occurred within a mean of 10 +/- 8 days of the index admission, and their inpatient mortality was 6.7% vs. 1.7% among readmissions that had no QOC problems (odds ratio, 4.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-16.7). The main pitfalls identified during the index admission included incomplete workup (33%), too short hospital stay (31%), inappropriate medication (44%), diagnostic error (16%), and disregarding a significant laboratory result (12%). In many patients more than 1 pitfall was identified (mean, 1.5 per patient). Risk factors for preventable readmission include older age and living in an institution (p &lt; 0.05). Almost two-thirds of the readmitted patients with QOC problems were discharged after spending 2 days or fewer at the hospital. In conclusion, unplanned readmissions within 30 days of discharge are frequent, more prevalent in sicker patients, and possibly associated with increased mortality. In a third of readmitted patients a QOC problem can be identified, and these problems are preventable. Thus, readmission may be used as a screening tool for potential QOC problems in the department of medicine. Routine monitoring of all readmissions may provide a simple cost-effective means of identifying and addressing medical mistakes.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Goldfield, Norbert I</author><author>McCullough, Elizabeth C</author><author>Hughes, John S</author><author>Tang, Ana M</author><author>Eastman, Beth</author><author>Rawlins, Lisa K</author><author>Averill, Richard F</author><author>N.I., Goldfield</author><author>E.C., McCullough</author><author>J.S., Hughes</author><author>A.M., Tang</author><author>B., Eastman</author><author>L.K., Rawlins</author><author>F, Averill R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identifying potentially preventable readmissions</title><secondary-title>Health Care Financing Review</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Health Care Financing Review</full-title></periodical><pages>75-91</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>*health care cost</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*preventive health service</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis-Related Groups</keyword><keyword>Florida</keyword><keyword>Forecasting</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Quality of Health Care</keyword><keyword>Risk Assessment</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>controlled study</keyword><keyword>disease severity</keyword><keyword>health care management</keyword><keyword>health care quality</keyword><keyword>hospital admission</keyword><keyword>hospital cost</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>statistical model</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><pub-location>N.

The PPR logic determines whether the reason for readmission is clinically related to a prior admission, and therefore potentially preventable. The likelihood of a PPR was found to be dependent on severity of illness, extremes of age, and the presence of mental health diagnoses. Analyses using PPRs show that readmission rates increase with increasing severity of illness and increasing time between admission and readmission, vary by the type of prior admission, and are stable within hospitals over time.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kim, Hongsoo</author><author>Ross, Joseph S</author><author>Melkus, Gail D</author><author>Zhao, Zhonglin</author><author>Boockvar, Kenneth</author><author>H., Kim</author><author>J.S., Ross</author><author>G.D., Melkus</author><author>Z., Zhao</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Scheduled and unscheduled hospital readmissions among patients with diabetes</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Managed Care</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Managed Care</full-title></periodical><pages>760-767</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>California</keyword><keyword>Data Collection</keyword><keyword>Diabetes Complications</keyword><keyword>Diabetes Mellitus</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hospitalization</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Prognosis</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Socioeconomic Factors</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Q</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><pub-location>H.

STUDY DESIGN: Population-based data set study. METHODS: Using the 2006 California State Inpatient Dataset, we identified 124,967 patients 50 years or older with diabetes who were discharged from acute care hospitals between April and September 2006 and examined readmissions in the 3 months following their index hospitalizations. RESULTS: About 26.3% of patients were readmitted within the 3-month period following their index hospitalizations, 87.2% of which were unscheduled readmissions. Patients with unscheduled readmissions were more likely to have a higher comorbidity burden, be members of racial/ethnic minority groups with public insurance, and live in lower-income neighborhoods. Having a history of hospitalization in the 3 months preceding the index hospitalization was also a strong predictor of unscheduled readmissions. Almost one-fifth of unscheduled readmissions (constituting approximately 27,500 inpatient days and costing almost $72.7 million) were potentially preventable based on definitions of Prevention Quality Indicators by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Scheduled readmissions were less likely to occur among patients 80 years or older, the uninsured, and those with an unscheduled index hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: The predictors of scheduled and unscheduled readmissions are different. Transition care to prevent unscheduled readmissions in acutely ill patients with diabetes may help reduce rates, improving care. Further studies are needed on potential disparities in scheduled readmissions.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.K., Ang</author><author>J., Kua</author><author>P.C., Chiam</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A demographic profile and factors leading to unplanned readmission of psychogeriatric female patients in the acute ward</title><secondary-title>Annals of the Academy of Medicine Singapore</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of the Academy of Medicine Singapore</full-title></periodical><pages>S260</pages><volume>39</volume><issue>11 SUPPL. 1</issue><keywords><keyword>*Singapore</keyword><keyword>*female</keyword><keyword>*health</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*human</keyword><keyword>*patient</keyword><keyword>*ward</keyword><keyword>aftercare</keyword><keyword>aged</keyword><keyword>caregiver</keyword><keyword>case management</keyword><keyword>case manager</keyword><keyword>counseling</keyword><keyword>data mining</keyword><keyword>dementia</keyword><keyword>demography</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>mental health</keyword><keyword>psychoeducation</keyword><keyword>respite care</keyword><keyword>schizophrenia</keyword><keyword>side effect</keyword><keyword>suicide</keyword><keyword>widowed person</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><pub-location>S.K.

The case manager (CM) on the ward ensures the continuity and coordination of care for these patients on admission and upon discharge. This paper analyses the demographic profile and factors leading to unplanned readmissions (UR). UR is categorised as admission within 30 days of discharge other than for respite care. Methods: Data mining of patients admitted to the ward from June 2006 to May 2010 was done and results analysed using Microsoft Excel programme. Results: Of the 974 patients admitted, 938 were accepted for case management after assessment. Fifty-nine (6%) were classified as UR of whom 36% diagnosed with Dementia and 37% Schizophrenia. Social demography revealed that the majority of patients (78%) were Chinese. Seventy-six percent were between 71 to 90 years old and 80% widowed. Many had repeated admissions. Reasons for admission were 48% caregivers' stress 10% suicide threat 10% refusing medicine 7% request from caregiver for admission 7% medication side effects 5% social reasons 3% medical reasons 9% other issues Patients and carers were provided with psychoeducation, counseling, linkages to essential services and telephonic case management. Only 3 (5%) of the 59 patients experienced another UR after discharge. Discussion &amp; Conclusion: Results of the survey indicate that caregiver stress contributed to a high percentage of UR. Therefore strategies to alleviate this factor, namely, psychoeducation, support, family sessions and telephonic case management will be enhanced by case managers in their aftercare services to patients and carers.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Walraven, Carl</author><author>Dhalla, Irfan A</author><author>Bell, Chaim</author><author>Etchells, Edward</author><author>Stiell, Ian G</author><author>Zarnke, Kelly</author><author>Austin, Peter C</author><author>Forster, Alan J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Derivation and validation of an index to predict early death or unplanned readmission after discharge from hospital to the community.</title><secondary-title>CMAJ</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CMAJ</full-title></periodical><pages>551-557</pages><volume>182</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>*death</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*prediction</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Canada</keyword><keyword>Comorbidity</keyword><keyword>Emergency Service</keyword><keyword>Emergency Service -- Utilization</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Forecasting</keyword><keyword>Health Status Indicators</keyword><keyword>Hospital</keyword><keyword>Human</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Length of Stay</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Age</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Patient Discharge</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Prognosis</keyword><keyword>Readmission</keyword><keyword>accuracy</keyword><keyword>adult</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>community</keyword><keyword>comorbidity</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>hospital discharge</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>major clinical study</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>outcome assessment</keyword><keyword>patient care</keyword><keyword>prospective study</keyword><keyword>quantitative analysis</keyword><keyword>surgical patient</keyword><keyword>utilization</keyword><keyword>validation process</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><pub-location>Clinical Epidemiology Program, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Ottawa Hospital, and the Department of Emergency Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Ontario. carlv@ohri.ca</pub-location><publisher>8872147 Canada Inc.</publisher><isbn>0820-3946</isbn><accession-num>20194559</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1503/cmaj.091117</electronic-resource-num><notes>LACE index paper

An easy-to-use index to quantify the risk of readmission or death after discharge from hospital would help clinicians identify patients who might benefit from more intensive post-discharge care. We sought to derive and validate an index to predict the risk of death or unplanned readmission within 30 days after discharge from hospital to the community. Methods: In a prospective cohort study, 48 patient-level and admission-level variables were collected for 4812 medical and surgical patients who were discharged to the community from 11 hospitals in Ontario. We used a split-sample design to derive and validate an index to predict the risk of death or nonelective readmission within 30 days after discharge. This index was externally validated using administrative data in a random selection of 1 000 000 Ontarians discharged from hospital between 2004 and 2008. Results: Of the 4812 participating patients, 385 (8.0%) died or were readmitted on an unplanned basis within 30 days after discharge. Variables independently associated with this outcome (from which we derived the nmemonic &quot;LACE&quot;) included length of stay (&quot;L&quot;); acuity of the admission (&quot;A&quot;); comorbidity of the patient (measured with the Charlson comorbidity index score) (&quot;C&quot;); and emergency department use (measured as the number of visits in the six months before admission) (&quot;E&quot;). Scores using the LACE index ranged from 0 (2.0% expected risk of death or urgent readmission within 30 days) to 19 (43.7% expected risk). The LACE index was discriminative (C statistic 0.684) and very accurate (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic 14.1, p = 0.59) at predicting outcome risk. Interpretation: The LACE index can be used to quantify risk of death or unplanned readmission within 30 days after discharge from hospital. This index can be used with both primary and administrative data. Further research is required to determine whether such quantification changes patient care or outcomes. © 2010 Canadian Medical Association.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lopez-Aguila, Silvia</author><author>Contel, Joan Carles</author><author>Farre, Josep</author><author>Campuzano, Jose Luis</author><author>Rajmil, Luis</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Predictive Model for Emergency Hospital Admission and 6-Month Readmission.</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Managed Care</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Managed Care</full-title></periodical><pages>e348-e357</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>*emergency health service</keyword><keyword>*hospital admission</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>80 and Over</keyword><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Aging</keyword><keyword>Confidence Intervals</keyword><keyword>Data Analysis</keyword><keyword>Data Analysis Software</keyword><keyword>Databases</keyword><keyword>Descriptive Statistics</keyword><keyword>Emergency Service</keyword><keyword>Factual</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Health Resource Utilization -- Evaluation</keyword><keyword>Hospital</keyword><keyword>Human</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Logistic Models</keyword><keyword>Logistic Regression</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Models</keyword><keyword>Odds Ratio</keyword><keyword>Organizational</keyword><keyword>Patient Admission -- Evaluation -- In Old Age</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Prognosis</keyword><keyword>ROC Curve</keyword><keyword>Readmission -- Evaluation -- In Old Age</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Spain</keyword><keyword>Statistical</keyword><keyword>adult</keyword><keyword>aged</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>cohort analysis</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>groups by age</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>major clinical study</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>predictive validity</keyword><keyword>primary medical care</keyword><keyword>priority journal</keyword><keyword>retrospective study</keyword><keyword>risk factor</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>utilization</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><pub-location>AgÃ¨ncia dÂ¿InformaciÃ³, AvaluaciÃ³ i Qualitat en Salut, Barcelona, Spain; Centro de InvestigaciÃ³n BiomÃ©dica en Red de EpidemiologÃ­a y Salud PÃºblica, Madrid, Spain</pub-location><publisher>Ascend Media (103 College Road East, Princeton NJ 08540, United States)</publisher><isbn>1088-0224</isbn><accession-num>21902442</accession-num><notes>From Duplicate 3 (Predictive Model for Emergency Hospital Admission and 6-Month Readmission. - LÃ³pez-AguilÃ, SÃ­lvia; Contel, Joan Carles; FarrÃ©, Josep; Campuzano, JosÃ© Luis; Rajmil, Luis)

Study Design: Retrospective cohort study. Methods: We used data from clinical records of the primary care centers, pharmacy database, and hospital discharge records for persons aged &gt;65 years registered in primary care centers of referral hospitals in the Baix Llobregat healthcare area. Unplanned hospital admission was defined as any unscheduled hospitalization in 2008; unplanned readmission was defined as any unscheduled admission occurring within 6 months after discharge date of index admission. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of unplanned hospital admission and readmission. Results: The population included 28,430 individuals. Among them, 2103 (7%) experienced an unplanned admission and 365 (1.3%) an unplanned readmission. The readmission rate for the admitted population was 18.7%. The strongest predictive factor of unplanned admission was &gt;2 admissions in the previous 2 years (odds ratio [OR] 24.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] 16.0-38.7 for 2007; OR 15.6, 95% CI 8.6-28.0 for 2006). Factors associated with unplanned readmission were aged &gt;80 years (OR 4.6, 95% CI 3.1-7.1) and &gt;2 admissions during the previous year (OR 20.4, 95% CI 14.1-29.5). The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve was 0.78 for unplanned admission and 0.85 for unplanned readmission in the development sample and 0.76 and 0.81, respectively, in the validation sample. Conclusions: Aged persons and those who used more hospital services in previous years had a higher probability of hospital admission and readmission.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>A., Narayana</author><author>I., Rubinfeld</author><author>L., Takis</author><author>M., Cumba</author><author>P., Perakis</author><author>D., Blyden</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sicu patients: Diagnosis at 30 day hospital read-mission</title><secondary-title>Critical Care Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Critical Care Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>166</pages><volume>39</volume><keywords><keyword>*day hospital</keyword><keyword>*diagnosis</keyword><keyword>*human</keyword><keyword>*intensive care</keyword><keyword>*patient</keyword><keyword>ICD-9</keyword><keyword>brain disease</keyword><keyword>car</keyword><keyword>fatigue</keyword><keyword>gastrointestinal symptom</keyword><keyword>health care system</keyword><keyword>hospital</keyword><keyword>hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>hypothesis</keyword><keyword>infection</keyword><keyword>lung disease</keyword><keyword>malaise</keyword><keyword>nutrition</keyword><keyword>organ systems</keyword><keyword>prevention</keyword><keyword>tissue graft</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><pub-location>A.

This has lead hospitals and payors to utilize 30 day hospital readmissions as a quality indicator and a harm prevention target. Previous literature has identified pulmonary issues as the most common cause for hospital readmission in mostly medical ICU patients. Hypothesis: We hypothesized that our readmission rate would be similar to MICU data but less related to pulmonary system issues. Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational review of patients that were admitted to the SICU. Those readmitted within 30 days of their initial visit to Henry Ford from January 2007 to December 2011 were analyzed using corporate data. The readmit diagnoses were categorized using ICD-9 codes and further subcategorized based on organ system dysfunction. Results: 9896 SICU patients were discharged from the hospital. 1735 were readmitted within 30 days. Percentage of readmissions as characterized by organ system dysfunction were as follows: GI(22.9%), Infection(22.1%), car-diovascular(16.2%), pulmonary(9.4%), GU/Renal(6.5%), Neurological(6.0%), Musculoskeletal(5.1%), lab abnormality(2.9%), Miscellaneous (2.8%), Sep-sis(2.5%), OB/GYN(0.4%), Nutrition(0.3%). Miscellaneous (MISC) category included ICD-9 codes that could not be generalized under any individual organ system (example: malaise and fatigue, tissue graft malfunction, Encephalopathy, unspecified). Conclusions: Our study supports the hypothesis that readmissions to the SICU 30 days after discharge are common. However, we found that GI complaints were the most frequent diagnosis. This could relate to underlying biases not analyzed here, including that MICU patients tend to have pulmonary disorders both acutely and chronically. Our study is retrospective and these factors should be examined prospectively in order to improve the discharge process and quality of care.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kansagara, Devan</author><author>Englander, Honora</author><author>Salanitro, Amanda</author><author>Kagen, David</author><author>Theobald, Cecelia</author><author>Freeman, Michele</author><author>Kripalani, Sunil</author><author>D., Kansagara Kagen</author><author>H., Englander</author><author>A., Salanitro</author><author>D., Kansagara Kagen</author><author>C., Theobald</author><author>M., Freeman</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Risk prediction models for hospital readmission: A systematic review</title><secondary-title>JAMA - Journal of the American Medical Association</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JAMA - Journal of the American Medical Association</full-title></periodical><pages>1688-1698</pages><volume>306</volume><issue>15</issue><keywords><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*prediction</keyword><keyword>*statistical model</keyword><keyword>Forecasting</keyword><keyword>Hospitalization</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Models</keyword><keyword>Outcome Assessment (Health Care)</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Risk Adjustment</keyword><keyword>Risk Assessment</keyword><keyword>Statistical</keyword><keyword>acute heart infarction</keyword><keyword>age</keyword><keyword>asthma</keyword><keyword>caregiver</keyword><keyword>cognitive defect</keyword><keyword>comorbidity</keyword><keyword>congestive heart failure</keyword><keyword>creatinine/ec [Endogenous Compound]</keyword><keyword>data analysis</keyword><keyword>disease severity</keyword><keyword>educational status</keyword><keyword>employment status</keyword><keyword>ethnicity</keyword><keyword>functional status</keyword><keyword>gender</keyword><keyword>health care access</keyword><keyword>health insurance</keyword><keyword>health status</keyword><keyword>hearing impairment</keyword><keyword>heart failure</keyword><keyword>heart infarction</keyword><keyword>high risk patient</keyword><keyword>hospital discharge</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>household</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>marriage</keyword><keyword>medical service</keyword><keyword>medicare</keyword><keyword>mental disease</keyword><keyword>pneumonia</keyword><keyword>priority journal</keyword><keyword>quality of life</keyword><keyword>retrospective study</keyword><keyword>review</keyword><keyword>risk assessment</keyword><keyword>social aspect</keyword><keyword>social support</keyword><keyword>systematic review</keyword><keyword>visual impairment</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><pub-location>D.

Objective: To summarize validated readmission risk prediction models, describe their performance, and assess suitability for clinical or administrative use. Data Sources and Study Selection: The databases of MEDLINE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception through March 2011, the EMBASE database was searched through August 2011, and hand searches were performed of the retrieved reference lists. Dual review was conducted to identify studies published in the English language of prediction models tested with medical patients in both derivation and validation cohorts. Data Extraction: Data were extracted on the population, setting, sample size, follow-up interval, readmission rate, model discrimination and calibration, type of data used, and timing of data collection. Data Synthesis: Of 7843 citations reviewed, 30 studies of 26 unique models met the inclusion criteria. The most common outcome used was 30-day readmission; only 1 model specifically addressed preventable readmissions. Fourteen models that relied on retrospective administrative data could be potentially used to risk-adjust readmission rates for hospital comparison; of these, 9 were tested in large US populations and had poor discriminative ability (c statistic range: 0.55-0.65). Seven models could potentially be used to identify high-risk patients for intervention early during a hospitalization (c statistic range: 0.56-0.72), and 5 could be used at hospital discharge (c statistic range: 0.68-0.83). Six studies compared different models in the same population and 2 of these found that functional and social variables improved model discrimination. Although most models incorporated variables for medical comorbidity and use of prior medical services, few examined variables associated with overall health and function, illness severity, or social determinants of health. Conclusions: Most current readmission risk prediction models that were designed for either comparative or clinical purposes perform poorly. Although in certain settings such models may prove useful, efforts to improve their performance are needed as use becomes more widespread. ©2011 American Medical Association.

In addition, the utility of readmission rates as a quality metric depends on accurate prediction of the readmission rate expected in a given population. We performed a systematic review of risk prediction models for hospital readmission. METHODS: We searched Ovid MEDLINE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library (Central Trial Registry, Systematic Reviews, and Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness) from database inception through June 2010 for English-language studies of readmission risk prediction models for adult medical patients. We had searched reference lists of reviews and relevant articles. Each full-text article was independently assessed by two reviewers for inclusion. We only included models tested in both a derivation and validation cohort. RESULTS: From 6089 abstracts, we reviewed 141 full-text articles. Thirty-two articles examining twenty risk models met inclusion criteria. Most of these modeled the risk of all-cause readmissions ranging from 30 days to one year post-discharge. Only one study specifically distinguished potentially preventable readmissions. Most models relied on readily available administrative data, though 8 of 20 models did incorporate primary data from surveys or chart review. The ability of most models to accurately distinguish high from low readmission risk was poor to fair (11/13 models with available data reported a c-statistic of &lt;0.70; range 0.60-0.83). Almost all models (19/20) included comorbidity variables and most (17/20) included utilization variables such as prior hospitalization. Most models examined basic sociodemographic factors such as age, sex, and race, but only seven examined other patient characteristics such as social support, behavioral risks, and depression. Prior hospitalization was consistently among the factors most predictive of readmission. However, given the differences in populations and risk factors examined, it is unclear which other risk factors are consistently associated with readmission risk. CONCLUSION: Many statistical models predicting readmission risk have been evaluated, but their predictive ability is modest. This may reflect the very complexity of factors that contribute to readmission risk. Many models use administrative data and could be readily deployed at a health system level, but limited accuracy may temper their utility as quality metric tools. Moreover, potentially important clinical and sociodemographic variables are often overlooked. Future studies should assess the value of modeling patient characteristics that could be targeted by interventions such as health literacy, depression, and medication adherence.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Morris, David S</author><author>Rohrbach, Jeff</author><author>Rogers, Mary</author><author>Thanka Sundaram, Latha Mary</author><author>Sonnad, Seema</author><author>Pascual, Jose</author><author>Sarani, Babak</author><author>Reilly, Patrick</author><author>Sims, Carrie</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The surgical revolving door: Risk factors for hospital readmission</title><secondary-title>Journal of Surgical Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Surgical Research</full-title></periodical><pages>297-301</pages><volume>170</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Acute Kidney Injury</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Comorbidity</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hospital</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Length of Stay</keyword><keyword>Logistic Models</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Multivariate Analysis</keyword><keyword>Patient Discharge</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Postoperative Complications</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Surgery Department</keyword><keyword>Wounds and Injuries</keyword><keyword>Young Adult</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><pub-location>D.S.

We sought to identify risk factors associated with early readmission in surgical patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All admissions from a mixed surgical unit during 2009 were retrospectively reviewed and unplanned readmissions within 30 d of discharge were identified. Demographic data, length of stay, pre-existing diagnoses, and complications during the index admission were evaluated. T-tests and Fisher exact tests were used to examine the relationship of independent variables with readmission. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis were performed. RESULTS: A total of 1808 index admissions occurred during the study period. In all, 51 (3%) patients were readmitted within 30 d of discharge. The majority of readmissions (53%) were for infectious reasons. On univariate analyses, DVT (P = 0.004) and acute renal failure (P = 0.002) were associated with increased risk of readmission. Readmitted patients were also more likely to have public insurance (63% versus 37%, P = 0.03) and have a longer stay in the hospital (8 d, range 4-14 d versus 3 d, range 2-7 d, P = 0.001). Initial admission after trauma evaluation was associated with a decreased risk of readmission (OR 0.374, P = 0.004). Other demographic variables and pre-existing conditions were not associated with increased readmission. On multivariate logistic regression only DVT (P = 0.039) and LOS (P = 0.014) remained significant. CONCLUSIONS: Increased LOS and the development of a DVT are risk factors for early unplanned hospital readmission. Admission following trauma is associated with a decreased risk of readmission, possibly due to proactive multidisciplinary discharge planning and geographically-based nurse practitioner involvement.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gruneir, Andrea</author><author>Dhalla, Irfan A</author><author>van Walraven, Carl</author><author>Fischer, Hadas D</author><author>Camacho, Ximena</author><author>Rochon, Paula A</author><author>Anderson, Geoffrey M</author><author>A., Gruneir</author><author>I.A., Dhalla</author><author>C., van Walraven</author><author>H.D., Fischer</author><author>X., Camacacho</author><author>P.A., Rochon</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Unplanned readmissions after hospital discharge among patients identified as being at high risk for readmission using a validated predictive algorithm</title><secondary-title>Open Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Open Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>104-111</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>*comorbidity</keyword><keyword>*hospital discharge</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*length of stay</keyword><keyword>*patient care</keyword><keyword>80 and over</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Algorithms</keyword><keyword>Canada/ep [Epidemiology]</keyword><keyword>Comorbidity</keyword><keyword>Continuity of Patient Care</keyword><keyword>Emergency Service</keyword><keyword>Episode of Care</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hospital</keyword><keyword>Hospital Mortality</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Length of Stay</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Medical Records</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Ontario</keyword><keyword>Patient Discharge</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Patient Selection</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>aged</keyword><keyword>algorithm</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>emergency health service</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>medical record</keyword><keyword>middle aged</keyword><keyword>mortality</keyword><keyword>organization &amp; administration</keyword><keyword>organization and management</keyword><keyword>patient selection</keyword><keyword>reproducibility</keyword><keyword>risk factor</keyword><keyword>standard</keyword><keyword>standards</keyword><keyword>statistics</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>time</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><pub-location>A.

Strategies designed to reduce readmissions should target patients at high risk. The purpose of this study was to describe medical patients identified using a recently published and validated algorithm (the LACE index) as being at high risk for readmission and to examine their actual hospital readmission rates. Methods: We used populationbased administrative data to identify adult medical patients discharged alive from 6 hospitals in Toronto, Canada, during 2007. A LACE index score of 10 or higher was used to identify patients at high risk for readmission. We described patient and hospitalization characteristics among both the highrisk and lowrisk groups as well as the 30day readmission rates. Results: Of 26 045 patients, 12.6% were readmitted to hospital within 30 days and 20.9% were readmitted within 90 days of discharge. Highrisk patients (LACE &gt; 10) accounted for 34.0% of the sample but 51.7% of the patients who were readmitted within 30 days. Highrisk patients were readmitted with twice the frequency as other patients, had longer lengths of stay and were more likely to die during the readmission. Interpretation: Using a LACE index score of 10, we identified patients with a high rate of readmission who may benefit from improved postdischarge care. Our findings suggest that the LACE index is a potentially useful tool for decisionmakers interested in identifying appropriate patients for postdischarge interventions.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>C, van Walraven</author><author>Bennett, C</author><author>Jennings, A</author><author>PC, Austin</author><author>AJ, Forster</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Proportion of hospital readmissions deemed avoidable: a systematic review.</title><secondary-title>CMAJ: Canadian Medical Association Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CMAJ: Canadian Medical Association Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>E391-402 1p</pages><volume>183</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Clinical Indicators -- Standards</keyword><keyword>Clinical Indicators -- Statistics and Numerical Da</keyword><keyword>Human</keyword><keyword>Readmission -- Standards</keyword><keyword>Readmission -- Statistics and Numerical Data</keyword><keyword>Regression</keyword><keyword>Systematic Review</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><pub-location>Ottowa, Ontario</pub-location><publisher>8872147 Canada Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1503/cmaj.101860</electronic-resource-num><notes>Accession Number: 104873971.

However, this approach is valid only when we know what proportion of readmissions are avoidable. We conducted a systematic review of studies that measured the proportion of readmissions deemed avoidable. We examined how such readmissions were measured and estimated their prevalence. Methods: We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases to identify all studies published from 1966 to July 2010 that reviewed hospital readmissions and that specified how many were classified as avoidable. Results: Our search strategy identified 34 studies. Three of the studies used combinations of administrative diagnostic codes to determine whether readmissions were avoidable. Criteria used in the remaining studies were subjective. Most of the studies were conducted at single teaching hospitals, did not consider information from the community or treating physicians, and used only one reviewer to decide whether readmissions were avoidable. The median proportion of readmissions deemed avoidable was 27.1% but varied from 5% to 79%. Three study-level factors (teaching status of hospital, whether all diagnoses or only some were considered, and length of follow-up) were significantly associated with the proportion of admissions deemed to be avoidable and explained some, but not all, of the heterogeneity between the studies. Interpretation: All but three of the studies used subjective criteria to determine whether readmissions were avoidable. Study methods had notable deficits and varied extensively, as did the proportion of readmissions deemed avoidable. The true proportion of hospital readmissions that are potentially avoidable remains unclear.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>R, Chang</author><author>S, Nichani</author><author>R., Chang</author><author>S., Nichani</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Readmissions-the same old thing?</title><secondary-title>Journal of Hospital Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Hospital Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>S102</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>4 SUPPL. 2</issue><keywords><keyword>*hospital</keyword><keyword>clinical assessment</keyword><keyword>data base</keyword><keyword>diagnosis related group</keyword><keyword>electronic medical record</keyword><keyword>general practice</keyword><keyword>hospital patient</keyword><keyword>hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>imaging</keyword><keyword>kappa statistics</keyword><keyword>laboratory</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>medical record review</keyword><keyword>patient</keyword><keyword>patient identification</keyword><keyword>sample size</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><pub-location>R.

It is believed that many patients are readmitted because of a recurrence or worsening of the same condition for which they were originally hospitalized. Such readmissions might be preventable if related to inadequate treatment or poor care transitions. However, the degree to which patient readmissions occur for the same reason remains uncertain, as most studies thus far have relied on administrative data. Purpose: To determine (1) the accuracy of billing data compared with clinical chart review in determining the reason for readmissions and (2) whether patients were readmitted for the same reason as the original admission based on clinical assessment. Description: All patients who were readmitted in November 2009 within 30 days of their discharge from the inpatient general medicine service were included. Sixty-seven unique patients were identified. Administrative data regarding patient identification, reason for initial and subsequent admissions, demographic data, and length of stay were obtained. Only the first readmission was evaluated if more than 1 readmission occurred. Data elements in the chart review of the electronic medical record included discharge summaries, laboratory data, radiographic imaging, and inpatient progress notes from the primary and consulting services. Two reviewers evaluated the data independently looking at (1) the primary reasons (up to 4) for initial admission, (2) primary reasons for readmission, (3) whether these reasons matched the primary billing diagnosis- related group (DRG) code listed for admission and readmission, and (4) categorizing the readmission into 1 of 4 nominal categories: same-planned, same-unplanned, different- planned, and different-unplanned. Cohen's kappa coefficient was used to calculate the degree of interrater agreement. The reasons for both admission and readmission in the administrative billing record matched the findings of the clinical reviewers in only 34 cases (51%). Only 8 readmissions (12%) were planned. Of the unplanned readmissions, 31 patients (46%) were readmitted for the same reasons and 28 (42%) for different reasons from their index hospitalization. The K coefficien t was 0.63 between observers. Conclusions: The majority of patients in this sample were readmitted in an unplanned fashion. Of these, only half were for reasons similar to their index hospitalization. Moreover, discrepancies in the reason for admission between billing DRG and clinical chart review were found in a substantial number of patients, highlighting the limited accuracy of using administrative databases for this purpose. These results are limited by sample size, single-center experience, and the retrospective nature of the study.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M, Rothwell</author><author>C, Jukka</author><author>E, Lum</author><author>C, Mitchell</author><author>M., Rothwell</author><author>C., Jukka</author><author>E., Lum</author><author>C., Mitchell</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Retrospective analysis of emergency readmissions to rural and regional hospitals</title><secondary-title>Journal of Pharmacy Practice and Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Pharmacy Practice and Research</full-title></periodical><pages>290-294</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>*emergency care</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>aged</keyword><keyword>analgesic agent</keyword><keyword>antibiotic agent</keyword><keyword>antibiotic therapy</keyword><keyword>antithrombocytic agent</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>cardiovascular agent</keyword><keyword>clinical assessment</keyword><keyword>diuretic agent</keyword><keyword>donepezil</keyword><keyword>drug withdrawal</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>general practitioner</keyword><keyword>health care delivery</keyword><keyword>heparin</keyword><keyword>hospital discharge</keyword><keyword>hospital management</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>hydroxyurea</keyword><keyword>indapamide</keyword><keyword>insulin</keyword><keyword>insulin treatment</keyword><keyword>iron</keyword><keyword>major clinical study</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>medical information</keyword><keyword>medication therapy management</keyword><keyword>patient compliance</keyword><keyword>patient monitoring</keyword><keyword>pharmacist</keyword><keyword>regionalization</keyword><keyword>retrospective study</keyword><keyword>rural area</keyword><keyword>temazepam</keyword><keyword>treatment outcome</keyword><keyword>verapamil</keyword><keyword>warfarin</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><pub-location>M.

Missing medication information at discharge was identified as a contributor to hospital readmissions. Aim: To identify unplanned readmissions within 28 days of hospital discharge attributable to medications; to assess preventability; and in the medication-related readmissions to identify the medication management information supplied to the GP on initial discharge and whether these patients were seen by a pharmacist during the initial stay and readmission. Method: Records were analysed of patients who had an unplanned readmission within 28 days of discharge, aged 65 years and over, and on 3 or more medications at the time of discharge. A documented method developed for measuring causality, preventability and contribution of medications to the readmission was utilised. Results: 170 patients from 1 regional and 2 rural hospitals were included in the analysis. 39 (23%) readmissions were medication related and 34 (87%) of these were preventable. Dominant reasons for readmission were inadequate communication/monitoring (41%) and inappropriate/suboptimal pharmacological therapy at discharge (62%). Conclusion: Gaps in communicating medication management information across the hospital-community interface continue to contribute to avoidable unplanned readmissions.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Navarro, Adria E</author><author>Enguidanos, Susan</author><author>Wilber, Kathleen H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identifying risk of hospital readmission among Medicare aged patients: an approach using routinely collected data.</title><secondary-title>Home health care services quarterly</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Home health care services quarterly</full-title></periodical><pages>181-195</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Aged, 80 and over</keyword><keyword>Chronic Disease</keyword><keyword>Comorbidity</keyword><keyword>Data Collection</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Logistic Models</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Medicare</keyword><keyword>Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Predictive Value of Tests</keyword><keyword>Quality of Health Care</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Management</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><accession-num>22656916</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/01621424.2012.681561</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Readmission provisions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of March 2010 have created urgent fiscal accountability requirements for hospitals, dependent upon a better understanding of their specific populations, along with development of mechanisms to easily identify these at-risk patients. Readmissions are disruptive and costly to both patients and the health care system. Effectively addressing hospital readmissions among Medicare aged patients offers promising targets for resources aimed at improved quality of care for older patients. Routinely collected data, accessible via electronic medical records, were examined using logistic models of sociodemographic, clinical, and utilization factors to identify predictors among patients who required rehospitalization within 30 days. Specific comorbidities and discharge care orders in this urban, nonprofit hospital had significantly greater odds of predicting a Medicare aged patient's risk of readmission within 30 days.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>P., Mudireddy</author><author>W., Blonski</author><author>A., Tierney</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Unplanned hospital readmissions in IBD patients: Predictive factors</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Gastroenterology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Gastroenterology</full-title></periodical><pages>S655</pages><volume>107</volume><keywords><keyword>*college</keyword><keyword>*gastroenterology</keyword><keyword>*hospital</keyword><keyword>*human</keyword><keyword>*patient</keyword><keyword>Fisher exact test</keyword><keyword>antibiotic agent</keyword><keyword>chi square test</keyword><keyword>clinical feature</keyword><keyword>colonoscopy</keyword><keyword>data base</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>health care cost</keyword><keyword>hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>insurance</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>mental disease</keyword><keyword>mesalazine</keyword><keyword>prospective study</keyword><keyword>social aspect</keyword><keyword>statistical analysis</keyword><keyword>steroid</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>tobacco</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><pub-location>P.

However, it is unknown which factors are associated with unplanned readmissions in IBD patients. The aim of this study was to determine the predictive factors of unplanned readmissions at 3-mos and 1-yr. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the electronic database of our institution (3 large academic hospitals) to identify consecutive pts admitted between Jan 2009 to Sept 2010 with primary discharge diagnosis of either UC or CD. Index admission was defined as first unplanned admission during this period. Readmission was defined as unplanned admission (due to any cause) occurring within 3 mos and 1 yr from the index admission. To identify factors predictive of readmissions, we compared social, demographic and clinical features at index admission of pts with readmission and those with no readmissions. The following data was extracted: demographics (age, sex, race, insurance), BMI, tobacco use, source of admission (ED, transfer, direct admit), type of IBD, yrs of disease, surgery prior to index admission, surgery during index admission, medications during index admission and at discharge (antibiotics, steroids, mesalamine, immunomodulators, biologics), colonoscopy, use of TPN, ICU stay, number of comorbities (&gt;3 or &lt;3), history of psychiatric illness. The statistical analysis was done by chi square test and Fisher Exact test. p&lt;0.05 was considered significant. Results: A total of 558 pts with IBD accounted for 1056 admissions within this time period. 209 pts had an index admission with a primary discharge diagnosis of either UC or CD. There were 160 unplanned readmissions. The unplanned readmission rates were-18% at 3 mos and 36.4% at 1 yr. 102 of 209 consecutive pts were analyzed. Their demographic information is:mean age 37.6 yrs, 58% females, 68% Whites, 73 had CD, 29 had UC, mean duration of IBD 8.5 yrs, median length of stay 6 days.24 pts were readmitted at least once within 3 mos and 51 were readmitted at least once within 1 yr. Male sex was predictive of 3-mo readmission (p=0.021) but not 1-yr readmission (p=0.071). None of the other demographic, clinical or social factors analyzed were predictive of either 3-mo or 1-yr readmissions. Conclusion: Based on our results we conclude that despite high rates of both 3-mo and 1-yr unplanned readmissions in IBD patients, there were no demographic, clinical or social factors predictive of unplanned readmissions except male sex. Since frequent admissions are currently deemed to be indicators of poor quality of care, future prospective studies on large number of patients are needed to identify why males are more likely to be readmitted within 3 mos and further help identify modifiable factors to prevent readmissions and thereby conserve healthcare costs.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Walraven, Carl</author><author>Wong, Jenna</author><author>Forster, Alan J</author><author>C., van Walraven</author><author>J., Wong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Derivation and validation of a diagnostic score based on case-mix groups to predict 30-day death or urgent readmission</title><secondary-title>Open medicine : a peer-reviewed, independent, open-access journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Open medicine : a peer-reviewed, independent, open-access journal</full-title></periodical><pages>e90-e100</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>*death</keyword><keyword>*diagnosis related group</keyword><keyword>*statistics and numerical data</keyword><keyword>80 and over</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Canada</keyword><keyword>Cohort Studies</keyword><keyword>Comorbidity</keyword><keyword>Death</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis-Related Groups</keyword><keyword>Emergencies</keyword><keyword>Emergency Service</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Forecasting</keyword><keyword>Hospital</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Length of Stay</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Ontario</keyword><keyword>Patient Acuity</keyword><keyword>Patient Discharge</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Risk Adjustment</keyword><keyword>adult</keyword><keyword>aged</keyword><keyword>cohort analysis</keyword><keyword>comorbidity</keyword><keyword>emergency</keyword><keyword>emergency health service</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>forecasting</keyword><keyword>hospital discharge</keyword><keyword>hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>middle aged</keyword><keyword>patient acuity</keyword><keyword>procedures</keyword><keyword>risk assessment</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>utilization</keyword><keyword>validation study</keyword><keyword>very elderly</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><pub-location>Canada</pub-location><accession-num>23687525</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=emed10b&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=23687525</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND: Between 5% and 10% of patients die or are urgently readmitted within 30 days of discharge from hospital. Readmission risk indexes have either excluded acute diagnoses or modelled them as multiple distinct variables. In this study, we derived and validated a score summarizing the influence of acute hospital diagnoses and procedures on death or urgent readmission within 30 days., METHODS: From population-based hospital abstracts in Ontario, we randomly sampled 200 000 discharges between April 2003 and March 2009 and determined who had been readmitted urgently or died within 30 days of discharge. We used generalized estimating equation modelling, with a sample of 100 000 patients, to measure the adjusted association of various case-mix groups (CMGs-homogenous groups of acute care inpatients with similar clinical and resource-utilization characteristics) with 30-day death or urgent readmission. This final model was transformed into a scoring system that was validated in the remaining 100 000 patients., RESULTS: Patients in the derivation set belonged to 1 of 506 CMGs and had a 6.8% risk of 30-day death or urgent readmission. Forty-seven CMG codes (more than half of which were directly related to chronic diseases) were independently associated with this outcome, which led to a CMG score that ranged from -6 to 7 points. The CMG score was significantly associated with 30-day death or urgent readmission (unadjusted odds ratio for a 1-point increase in CMG score 1.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.49-1.56). Alone, the CMG score was only moderately discriminative (C statistic 0.650, 95% CI 0.644-0.656). However, when the CMG score was added to a validated risk index for death or readmission, the C statistic increased to 0.759 (95% CI 0.753-0.765). The CMG score was well calibrated for 30-day death or readmission., INTERPRETATION: In this study, we developed a scoring system for acute hospital diagnoses and procedures that could be used as part of a risk-adjustment methodology for analyses of postdischarge outcomes.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>P., Mudireddy</author><author>W., Blonski</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Unplanned hospital readmission rates and causes in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: A critical analysis</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Gastroenterology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Gastroenterology</full-title></periodical><pages>S654-S655</pages><volume>107</volume><keywords><keyword>*college</keyword><keyword>*enteritis</keyword><keyword>*gastroenterology</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*human</keyword><keyword>*patient</keyword><keyword>abdominal pain</keyword><keyword>cholecystitis</keyword><keyword>data base</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>health care</keyword><keyword>health care quality</keyword><keyword>hospital</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>infection</keyword><keyword>inflammatory disease</keyword><keyword>intestine obstruction</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>marker</keyword><keyword>pancreatitis</keyword><keyword>postoperative complication</keyword><keyword>relapse</keyword><keyword>remission</keyword><keyword>risk factor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><pub-location>P.

Hospitalizations for exacerbations of IBD are common. Readmission has been deemed a marker of poor quality of care. The aim of this study was to better understand and characterize the rates of unplanned readmissions in IBD patients at 30 days, 90 days, 180 days and 1 yr and to identify the reasons for the unplanned readmissions. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the electronic database of our institution (3 large urban academic hospitals) to identify consecutive patients admitted between Jan 2009 to Sept 2010 with a primary discharge diagnosis of either UC or CD. Index admission was defined as first unplanned admission with primary discharge diagnosis of either UC or CD during this period. Readmission was defined as unplanned admission (due to any cause) occurring within 30 days, 90 days, 180 days or 1 year from the index admission. Data collected included demographics, type of IBD, length of stay, and primary discharge diagnosis for both index and readmission. Results: A total of 558 pts with IBD accounted for 1,056 admissions to the health system within this time period. Of these a total of 209 pts had an index admission with primary discharge diagnosis of either UC or CD. The demographics of the cohort were-mean age 37.5 yrs, 115 females, 149 whites, 150 had CD and 59 had UC. There were a total of 160 unplanned readmissions during the study period. The unplanned readmission rates were - 8.6% (18/209) at 30 days, 18% (37/209) at 90 days, 30.6% (64/209) at 180 days and 36.4% at 1 year. The mean length of stay (LOS) of all index admissions was 7.5 days and mean LOS of all readmissions was 7 days. Among the 76 pts readmitted at least once at 1 year, 38 were females, 47 were whites and 56 pts had CD. At 1 year, 33 pts were readmitted at least twice and 17 were readmitted more than 2 times. Eighty-five of the 160 readmissions had a primary discharge diagnosis of IBD (either CD or UC), while the rest of the 75 had other diagnoses at discharge. Infection was the most common other discharge diagnosis of readmissions (28/160), followed by postoperative complications (10/160), abdominal pain (5/160), bowel obstruction (4/160), pancreatitis (4/160), cholecystitis (4/160). Conclusion: The unplanned readmission rate in IBD pts is high, with more than one third of pts being readmitted at least once within 1 yr of discharge. The most common reasons for readmissions were IBD exacerbations and infections. Future large studies are needed to define national rates of readmission and risk factors for readmissions in IBD pts. This has the potential to better understand and possibly alter the standard of care.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Walraven, Carl</author><author>Wong, Jenna</author><author>Forster, Alan J</author><author>C., van Walraven</author><author>J., Wong</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>LACE+ index: extension of a validated index to predict early death or urgent readmission after hospital discharge using administrative data</title><secondary-title>Open medicine : a peer-reviewed, independent, open-access journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Open medicine : a peer-reviewed, independent, open-access journal</full-title></periodical><pages>e80-e90</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>*death</keyword><keyword>*statistics and numerical data</keyword><keyword>80 and over</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Canada</keyword><keyword>Cohort Studies</keyword><keyword>Comorbidity</keyword><keyword>Death</keyword><keyword>Emergencies</keyword><keyword>Emergency Service</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Forecasting</keyword><keyword>Hospital</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Length of Stay</keyword><keyword>Logistic Models</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Ontario</keyword><keyword>Patient Acuity</keyword><keyword>Patient Discharge</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>adult</keyword><keyword>aged</keyword><keyword>cohort analysis</keyword><keyword>comorbidity</keyword><keyword>emergency</keyword><keyword>emergency health service</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>forecasting</keyword><keyword>hospital discharge</keyword><keyword>hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>middle aged</keyword><keyword>patient acuity</keyword><keyword>procedures</keyword><keyword>risk factor</keyword><keyword>statistical model</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>utilization</keyword><keyword>validation study</keyword><keyword>very elderly</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><pub-location>Canada</pub-location><accession-num>23696773</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=emed10b&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=23696773</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND: Death or urgent readmission after hospital discharge is a common adverse event that can be used to compare outcomes of care between institutions. To accurately adjust for risk and to allow for interhospital comparisons of readmission rates, we used administrative data to derive and internally validate an extension of the LACE index, a previously validated index for 30-day death or urgent readmission., METHODS: We randomly selected 500 000 medical and surgical patients discharged to the community from any Ontario hospital between 1 April 2003 and 31 March 2009. We derived a logistic regression model on 250 000 randomly selected patients from this group and modified the final model into an index scoring system, the LACE+ index. We internally validated the LACE+ index using data from the remaining 250 000 patients and compared its performance with that of the original LACE index., RESULTS: Within 30 days of discharge to the community, 33 825 (6.8%) of the patients had died or had been urgently readmitted. In addition to the variables included in the LACE index (length of stay in hospital [L], acuity of admission [A], comorbidity [C] and emergency department utilization in the 6 months before admission [E]), the LACE+ index incorporated patient age and sex, teaching status of the discharge hospital, acute diagnoses and procedures performed during the index admission, number of days on alternative level of care during the index admission, and number of elective and urgent admissions to hospital in the year before the index admission. The LACE+ index was highly discriminative (C statistic 0.771, 95% confidence interval 0.767-0.775), was well calibrated across most of its range of scores and had a model performance that exceeded that of the LACE index., INTERPRETATION: The LACE+ index can be used to predict the risk of postdischarge death or urgent readmission on the basis of administrative data for the Ontario population. Its performance exceeds that of the LACE index, and it allows analysts to accurately estimate the risk of important postdischarge outcomes.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Walraven, Carl</author><author>Wong, Jenna</author><author>Hawken, Steven</author><author>Forster, Alan J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparing methods to calculate hospital-specific rates of early death or urgent readmission.</title><secondary-title>CMAJ</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CMAJ</full-title></periodical><pages>E810-7 1p</pages><volume>184</volume><issue>15</issue><keywords><keyword>*hospital patient</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*mortality</keyword><keyword>Canada</keyword><keyword>Clinical Indicators</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Health Care</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mortality</keyword><keyword>Ontario</keyword><keyword>Outcome Assessment</keyword><keyword>Outcome Assessment (Health Care)</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Quality Indicators</keyword><keyword>Readmission -- Statistics and Numerical Data</keyword><keyword>adult</keyword><keyword>age</keyword><keyword>aged</keyword><keyword>analytic method</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>gender</keyword><keyword>hospital discharge</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>intermethod comparison</keyword><keyword>major clinical study</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>measurement</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><pub-location>Ottowa, Ontario</pub-location><publisher>8872147 Canada Inc.</publisher><isbn>0820-3946</isbn><accession-num>23048081</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1503/cmaj.120801</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 2 (Comparing methods to calculate hospital-specific rates of early death or urgent readmission. - C, van Walraven; Wong, J; Hawken, S; AJ, Forster)

Hospital-specific readmission rates have been reported as a quality-of-care indicator. However, the extent to which these measures vary with different calculation methods is uncertain. Methods: We identified all discharges from Ontario hospitals from 2005 to 2010 and determined whether patients died or were urgently readmitted within 30 days. For each hospital, we calculated 4 distinct observed-to-expected ratios, estimating the expected number of events using different adjustments for confounders (age and sex v. complete) and different units of analysis (all admissions v. single admission per patient). Results: We included 3 148 648 admissions to hospital for 1 802 704 patients in 162 hospitals. Ratios adjusted for age and sex alone had the greatest variation. Within hospitals, ranges of the 4 ratios averaged 31% of the overall estimate. Readmission ratios adjusted for age and sex showed the lowest correlation (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.48-0.68). Hospital rankings based on the different measures had an average range of 47.4 (standard deviation 32.2) out of 162. Interpretation: We found notable variation in rates of death or urgent readmission within 30 days based on the extent of adjustment for confounders and the unit of analysis. Slight changes in the methods used to calculate hospital-specific readmission rates influence their values and the consequent rankings of hospitals. Our results highlight the caution required when comparing hospital performance using rates of death or urgent readmission within 30 days. © 2012 Canadian Medical Association or its licensors.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J, Lee</author><author>S, Pickering</author><author>C, Cutugno</author><author>M, Press</author><author>M, Unterbrink</author><author>M.E, Kelser</author><author>J, Richardson</author><author>J., Lee</author><author>S., Pickering</author><author>C., Cutugno</author><author>M., Press</author><author>M., Unterbrink</author><author>M.E., Kelser</author><author>J., Richardson</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identifying preventable readmissions: An interdisciplinary approach to building a conceptual model</title><secondary-title>Journal of Hospital Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Hospital Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>S8</pages><volume>7</volume><keywords><keyword>*hospital</keyword><keyword>*model</keyword><keyword>*society</keyword><keyword>consensus</keyword><keyword>grounded theory</keyword><keyword>hospital patient</keyword><keyword>hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>information processing</keyword><keyword>interdisciplinary research</keyword><keyword>nurse</keyword><keyword>outpatient</keyword><keyword>patient</keyword><keyword>physician</keyword><keyword>qualitative research</keyword><keyword>risk</keyword><keyword>scientist</keyword><keyword>semi structured interview</keyword><keyword>social worker</keyword><keyword>validity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><pub-location>J.

The problem is compounded by the lack of consensus on the defining criteria for preventable readmissions. We sought to define a comprehensive conceptual model that classified the etiologic subtypes of readmissions by incorporating the perspectives of patients, family, and the full spectrum of providers. Methods: We formed an interdisciplinary research team (physicians, nurses, researchers, and nonmedical staff) and used qualitative research methods based on grounded theory to conduct semistructured interviews and focus groups with readmitted patients and their &quot;care circle&quot; (families, hospital and home nurses, inpatient and outpatient physicians, and hospital social workers). These were conducted and audiotaped by members of the research team not directly involved with the patients' care. Responses were iteratively reviewed and coded to design a conceptual model detailing possible causes for readmission. To enhance validity, we triangulated findings using the overlapping perspectives of subjects and researchers to arrive at a comprehensive set of themes associated with readmission to a hospital. Results: We identified five primary categories depicted in the conceptual model below. These categories were identified as mechanisms through which the care circle could be disrupted, potentially increasing the risk of readmission. Conclusions: Readmissions are multifactorial, but preventability remains poorly defined. Our conceptual model provides a comprehensive set of categories that contributes to readmission based on the perspectives of the complete care circle. Our next step is to assess the preventability of these issues, so that efforts to reduce readmissions can focus on (Figure presented) these components as well as strengthen the linkages in the care circle.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M., Janjigian</author><author>D., Burke Bails</author><author>D., Burke Bails</author><author>M, Janjigian</author><author>D, Burke Bails</author><author>D, Burke Bails</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Factors contributing to 7-day readmissions in an urban teaching hospital</title><secondary-title>Journal of Hospital Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Hospital Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>S38</pages><volume>7</volume><keywords><keyword>*hospital</keyword><keyword>*society</keyword><keyword>*teaching hospital</keyword><keyword>algorithm</keyword><keyword>classification</keyword><keyword>consensus</keyword><keyword>data base</keyword><keyword>gender</keyword><keyword>health care</keyword><keyword>hospital patient</keyword><keyword>hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>medical record review</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>patient</keyword><keyword>patient compliance</keyword><keyword>physician</keyword><keyword>pilot study</keyword><keyword>prediction</keyword><keyword>reimbursement</keyword><keyword>risk</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><pub-location>M.

Most existing risk prediction models rely on administrative databases and have poor predictive ability. Physician chart reviews are necessary to identify both the cause and preventability of a readmission. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of 135 patients with an unplanned (Table presented) readmission to Bellevue Hospital within 7 days of discharge from the medicine service during a six month period. Each chart was reviewed independently by two experienced attending physicians. Using an algorithm developed via a pilot study, each readmission was classified into one of five categories: (1) not medically necessary (medical necessity), (2) following a discharge against medical advice (AMA), (3) related to a deficiency in the discharge process, (4) related to poor patient adherence (patient behavior) to the discharge plan, or (5) related to a condition that was difficult to predict. The latter three categories were further subcategorized to allow for more detailed analysis. Discrepancies in classification were resolved by consensus of the four authors. Baseline demographic information was obtained for the same time frame for patients who were not readmitted within 7 days. Results: During the study period there were 265 patients who were readmitted within seven days of discharge and 3,411 patients who were not. The gender ratio was not significantly different between groups (65% male in the readmitted group versus 62% male in the not readmitted group, P = 0.47). Age was significantly lower in the readmitted group (mean = 52.9 years) as compared to the not readmitted group (56.3; P = 0.001). Median length of stay (LOS) for the initial hospitalization was longer in the readmitted group (5 days vs 3 days; P = 0.0002). For the 135 readmitted cases, there was good agreement between reviewers (84%; j 0.776). The most common category of readmission was &quot;unpredictable&quot; (37.8%), followed by patient behavior (22.2%), discharge process (21.5%), medical necessity (9.6%), and AMA (8.9%). Conclusions: Our novel algorithm efficiently and reproducibly classified 7-day readmissions into discreet categories. Compared to all other patients, those who were readmitted within 7 days were more likely to be younger and have a longer initial LOS. We found 62% of readmissions were attributable to physician or patient behaviors, or system failures. This categorization algorithm can be used to guide creation of risk prediction models and allows for detailed analysis of individual groups that will assist development of individualized interventions to reduce rates of avoidable readmissions.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>N., Egorova</author><author>P., Vaishnava</author><author>M.B., Lipani</author><author>D., Ricks</author><author>C., Colgan</author><author>S., Bernstein</author><author>I., Nash</author><author>A., Gelijns</author><author>A., Moskowitz</author><author>N, Egorova</author><author>P, Vaishnava</author><author>M.B, Lipani</author><author>D, Ricks</author><author>C, Colgan</author><author>S, Bernstein</author><author>I, Nash</author><author>A, Gelijns</author><author>A, Moskowitz</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Validating the identification of patients at high risk for readmission by examining hospitalization history</title><secondary-title>Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes</full-title></periodical><pages>no pagination-no pagination</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>3 SUPPL. 1</issue><keywords><keyword>*cardiovascular disease</keyword><keyword>*cerebrovascular accident</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*hospitalization</keyword><keyword>*human</keyword><keyword>*outcomes research</keyword><keyword>*patient</keyword><keyword>*prediction</keyword><keyword>*risk</keyword><keyword>alcohol abuse</keyword><keyword>breast cancer</keyword><keyword>custody</keyword><keyword>diseases</keyword><keyword>high risk patient</keyword><keyword>hip fracture</keyword><keyword>hospital</keyword><keyword>intermedin</keyword><keyword>logistic regression analysis</keyword><keyword>medicare</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>morbidity</keyword><keyword>osteoporosis</keyword><keyword>patient identification</keyword><keyword>primary medical care</keyword><keyword>social worker</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><pub-location>N.

BACKGROUND: There is a federal mandate to reduce preventable readmissions. Predicting hospital readmission risk is of great interest to identify which patients would benefit most from transition interventions. Current models perform poorly. Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) has implemented the Preventable Admissions Care Team (PACT), which has achieved significant results for patients not targeted by other transitional programs. PACT, a social worker-led transitional program, decreased 30-day readmission rate from 30% to 12%, ED visits by 63%, and achieved a 90% primary care show rate at 7-10-days post-discharge. Patients are identified for PACT solely by readmission history: one readmission in 30 days or 2 in 6 months, prior to the index hospitalization. Thus, our objective here was to determine the concordance of predictions based on hospitalization history with a more formal risk model based on factors that characterize patients through demographics and comorbidities. METHODS: Using logistic regression, we developed a risk prediction model for readmission within 30-days. The model, which used patient demographics and co-morbidities (alcohol abuse, AMI, afib, breast cancer, CKD, COPD, CVA, depression, hip fracture, or osteoporosis), was developed in a cohort of Medicare FFS beneficiaries with a high proportion of cardiovascular disease, hospitalized at MSH. The higher the risk score, the higher risk of readmission. Scores of 0-2 had a 7% risk of readmission; scores of 3 or 4 and above 5 had 30-day readmission rates of 19%, and 29%, respectively. We then applied this risk scoring model to patients enrolled in PACT to determine how many of them would have been identified as high risk for readmission based on the regression model. RESULTS: A total of 393 patients were enrolled in PACT in a year and completed a 5 week intervention. Eighty seven percent had 1 cardiac comorbid illness (76% CAD, 66% CHF, and 17% Afib). Readmission data was available through 2010 thus, the analysis was completed for 111 patients. Ninety-five percent of PACT enrollees had a risk score greater than 3: 19 patients (17.1%) had a risk score of 3-4, and 87 patients (78.4%) had a risk score of 5 or greater. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization history alone is a reasonable proxy to more formal multivariable regression models in predicting 30-day readmission risk. If substantiated through further study, this could have national implications for real time high risk patient identification for transitional services.

Most existing risk prediction models perform poorly, do not differentiate between avoidable and unavoidable readmissions, or rely on information not commonly available prior to discharge. To help clinicians target transitional care interventions most effectively, we derived and internally validated a prediction model for potentially avoidable 30-day hospital readmissions in medical patients using readily available administrative and clinical data. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 10,731 admissions to the medical services of Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) during the 2009-2010 academic year. The outcome was an index admission followed by a potentially avoidable 30-day readmission to any service at BWH or to two other hospitals in the Partners Healthcare system, which together account for over 80% of readmissions. Potentially Avoidable Readmissions (PAR) were differentiated from non-avoidable readmissions using a validated computerized algorithm based on administrative data (SQLape) commonly used in Switzerland to benchmark and compare hospitals. Admissions were randomly assigned to derivation (2/3) and validation (1/3) sets. Baseline demographic data, previous health care utilization, co-morbid conditions, and laboratory testing were used as predictors in a logistic regression model with 30-day PAR as the dependent variable. RESULTS: There were 2,398 (22 %) admissions followed by a 30-day readmission, of which 1,101 (10%) were identified as PAR. The prediction score identified 6 independent factors, which we refer to as the PAR ScOrE: any ICD-9 coded Procedure, number of Admissions in the previous 12 months (0, 1 to 5, or &gt;5), Renal failure (glomerular filtration rate of 0-29, 30-59, or&gt;60 ml/min) at the time of discharge, low Sodium level (&lt; 135 mmol/l) at the time of discharge, discharge from an Oncology service, and Elective admission (Table). We then developed a scoring system to stratify risk of potentially avoidable 30- day readmission into 4 categories. With this prediction model, lowrisk patients having 0-1 points (13% of patients) had a 3% risk of PAR, while high-risk patients having &gt;7 points (15% of patients) had a 27% risk of PAR. The PAR ScOrE had a good discriminatory power (C-statistic 0.72 and 0.70) and had good calibration (Hosmer- Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic P=0.67 and P=0.72) in the derivation set and validation set, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This simple prediction model accurately identifies the risk of potentially avoidable 30-day readmission in medical patients. While it still needs external validation, this score has potential to easily identify patients in need of more intensive transitional care interventions to prevent avoidable hospital readmissions.

Hospitals that measure the proportion of urgent readmissions judged avoidable need to know previously published rates for comparison. In this study, we generated a literature-based estimate for the proportion of 30-day urgent readmissions deemed avoidable for hospitals to use to gauge their performance in avoidable readmissions. Methods We searched the Medline and Embase databases to identify published studies that reported the proportion of 30-day urgent readmissions deemed avoidable. We then modelled the overall proportion of 30-day urgent readmissions deemed avoidable. Results We included 16 studies that used a wide variety of patients and a diverse range of methods to classify readmissions as avoidable. Studies reported a broad range for the proportion of urgent 30-day readmissions deemed avoidable. Overall, 848 of 3669 readmissions (23.1%, 95% confidence interval, 21.7-24.5) of 30-day urgent readmissions were classified as avoidable. This proportion varied significantly based on hospital teaching status and number of reviewers for each case [teaching hospitals: with one reviewer, 9.3% (4.2-19.3); with &gt;1 reviewer, 21.6% (13.2-33.3); non-teaching hospital: with one reviewer, 32.2% (11.4-63.9); with &gt;1 reviewer, 39.9% (37.6-42.2)]. Significant heterogeneity remained between studies even after clustering studies by these covariates. Conclusions Less than one in four readmissions were deemed avoidable. Health system planners need to use caution in interpreting all cause readmission statistics as they are only partially influenced by quality of care. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lagoe, Ronald J</author><author>Nanno, Diane S</author><author>Luziani, Mary E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantitative tools for addressing hospital readmissions</title><secondary-title>BMC research notes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC research notes</full-title></periodical><pages>620</pages><volume>5</volume><keywords><keyword>*electronic medical record</keyword><keyword>*health care quality</keyword><keyword>*hospital patient</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>80 and over</keyword><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Electronic Health Records</keyword><keyword>Health Care Costs</keyword><keyword>Hospitalization</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Inpatients</keyword><keyword>Length of Stay</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Patient Discharge</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Quality of Health Care</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>Young Adult</keyword><keyword>adolescent</keyword><keyword>adult</keyword><keyword>aged</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>economics</keyword><keyword>health care cost</keyword><keyword>hospital discharge</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>middle aged</keyword><keyword>standard</keyword><keyword>standards</keyword><keyword>statistics</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>time</keyword><keyword>very elderly</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><pub-location>R.J.

Major payors have already developed financial penalties for providers that generate excess readmissions. This subject has benefitted from the development of resources such as the Potentially Preventable Readmissions software. This process has encouraged hospitals to renew efforts to improve these outcomes. The aim of this study was to describe quantitative tools such as definitions, risk estimation, and tracking of patients for reducing hospital readmissions. FINDINGS: This study employed the Potentially Preventable Readmissions software to develop quantitative tools for addressing hospital readmissions. These tools included two definitions of readmissions that support identification and management of patients. They also included analytical approaches for estimation of the risk of readmission for individual patients by age, discharge status of the initial admission, and severity of illness. They also included patient specific spreadsheets for tracking of target populations and for evaluation of the impact of interventions. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that quantitative tools including the development of definitions of readmissions, estimation of the risk of readmission, and patient specific spreadsheets could contribute to the improvement of patient outcomes in hospitals.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>D., White</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Unplanned readmission to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU).

Prevention of unplanned readmissions to the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) is a key factor when considering the quality of care received by our patients. Methods All admissions to the PICU during 2011 were examined and all readmissions to the unit were identified. A readmission was defined as those requiring PICU &lt; 48 hours following discharge. Patients who were readmitted for an elective procedure within the specified time were discounted. Results During 2011, 511 children had 615admissions to the PICU. 12 children were readmitted for acute care having deteriorated in the ward setting. 2 of the 12 children required 2 readmissions. 5 of the readmissions took place between April and September. The remaining 9 occurred during October to March. Conclusions It remains a subject of debate as to whether or not any of the redamissions could have been avoided as hindsight is always easy. With nearly double the amount readmissions occuring during the winter months, it could be argued that the children were discharged prematurely due to bed pressures. This a serious concern and one which we will continue to monitor.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wu, C X</author><author>Lim, T K</author><author>Chia, J</author><author>Hwang, C H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Risk Index to Predict 30 Days Emergency Hospital Readmission</title><secondary-title>Annals of the Academy of Medicine Singapore</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of the Academy of Medicine Singapore</full-title></periodical><pages>S225</pages><volume>42</volume><issue>9 SUPPL. 1</issue><keywords><keyword>*Singapore</keyword><keyword>*health</keyword><keyword>*hospital</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*human</keyword><keyword>*risk</keyword><keyword>cohort analysis</keyword><keyword>death</keyword><keyword>emergency ward</keyword><keyword>health care system</keyword><keyword>high risk patient</keyword><keyword>hospital discharge</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>logistic regression analysis</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>patient</keyword><keyword>risk factor</keyword><keyword>sample (statistics)</keyword><keyword>sensitivity and specificity</keyword><keyword>statistics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><pub-location>C.X.

Identifying high-risk patients and targeting intensive post-discharge interventions may help reduce readmissions. This study aims to develop and validate a predictive model to score patients' risk of emergency hospital readmission in an acute hospital in Singapore. Methods: In a retrospective cohort study, data were collected for medical patients discharged from Alexandra Hospital. We identified potential risk factors based on the variables used in the &quot;LACE&quot; index and &quot;HARRPE&quot; model. We constructed logistic regression models to predict readmission or death within 30 days and developed a risk index, using the methods described by Sullivan et al to score the readmission. C-statistics was used to measure discriminative ability and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test was used for calibration. Results: Of 3175 patient discharges, 20.3% were readmitted to hospital or died within 30 days of discharge. The variables independently associated with the outcome included admissions in previous 1 year, number of comorbidities, emergency department visits in previous 6 months and length of stay. The risk score was discriminative (c-statistics 0.763, 95% CI, 0.737 to 0.788) and accurate (Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic 11.46, P = 0.177) at predicting outcome risk. The optimal cut-off score that maximises sensitivity and specificity was 6. High-risk patients (score &gt;6) accounted for 32.0% of the sample, and had 4 times the risk of readmission or death within 30 days compared with other patients. Discussion &amp; Conclusion: Our findings provide a validated tool to enable the identification of high-risk patients by clinicians for intensive post-discharge intervention in Singapore.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>P.R., Mudireddy</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Unplanned hospital readmission rates and causes in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: A critical analysis</title><secondary-title>Gastroenterology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Gastroenterology</full-title></periodical><pages>S629</pages><volume>144</volume><issue>5 SUPPL. 1</issue><keywords><keyword>*enteritis</keyword><keyword>*gastrointestinal disease</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*human</keyword><keyword>*patient</keyword><keyword>data base</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>electronic medical record</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>health care</keyword><keyword>health care quality</keyword><keyword>hospital</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>infection</keyword><keyword>inflammatory disease</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>marker</keyword><keyword>relapse</keyword><keyword>remission</keyword><keyword>risk factor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><pub-location>P.R.

Hospitalizations for exacerbations of IBD are common. Readmission has been deemed a marker of poor quality of care. The aim of this study was to better understand and characterize the rates of unplanned readmissions in IBD patients at 1 mos, 3 mos, 6 mos and 1 yr and to identify the reasons for the unplanned readmissions. Preliminary data was previously presented by our group [AJG 2012 (107) Suppl. 1 S654-S655], however, this represents extensively updated new data and novel findings. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical record database of our institution (3 large urban academic hospitals) to identify consecutive patients admitted between Jan 2007 to Dec 2010 with a primary discharge diagnosis of either UC or CD. Index admission was defined as first unplanned admission with primary discharge diagnosis of either UC or CD during this period. Readmission was defined as unplanned admission (due to any cause) occurring within 1 mos, 3 mos, 6 mos or 1 yr from the index admission. Planned readmissions were excluded. Data analyzed included demographics, type of IBD, length of stay, and primary discharge diagnosis for both index admission and readmission. Results: A total of 975 pts with IBD accounted for 1345 admissions to the health system within this time period. Of these a total of 479 pts had an index admission with primary discharge diagnosis of either UC or CD. The demographics of the cohort were- mean age 38 yrs, 261 Females, 218 Males, 319 Whites, 132 Blacks, 28 Race other than White or Black, 312 had CD and 167 had UC. There were a total of 384 unplanned readmissions during the study period. The unplanned readmission rates were-12.5 %(60/479) at 1 mos, 23.4%(112/479) at 3 mos, 32.2%(154/ 479) at 6 mos and 38% (182/479) at 1 yr. The mean length of stay (LOS) of both index admissions and readmissions was 7.05 days, while median LOS of both Index and readmissions was 5. Among 60 pts readmitted at least once at 1 month, 19 were readmitted within 1-wk. Among the 182 pts readmitted at least once at 1 year, 90 were females,114 were whites, 61 were blacks, 7 were race other than white or black and 119 had CD, 63 had UC. At 1 yr, 85 pts were readmitted at least twice and 43 were readmitted more than 2 times. Please see table for causes of readmissions. Conclusion: The unplanned readmission rate in IBD pts is high, with more than one third of pts being readmitted at least once within 1 yr of discharge. The most common reasons for readmissions were IBD exacerbations and infections. Future large studies are needed to define national rates of readmission and risk factors for readmissions in IBD pts. This has the potential to better understand and possibly alter the standard of care.

METHODS: A retrospective review of all open ventral hernia repairs at a single institution from 2000 to 2010 was performed to assess readmissions between 1 to 30, 1 to 90, and 91 to 365 days. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of 30-day readmission. RESULTS: Of the 888 patients, 75 (8%) were readmitted between 1 and 30 days, 97 (11%) between 1 and 90 days, and 78 (9%) between 91 and 365 days. Unplanned readmissions related to the surgery constituted the majority of 1-day to 30-day and 1-day to 90-day readmissions (82% and 74%, respectively) but not between 91 and 365 days (32%). Prior superficial or deep surgical-site infection (odds ratio, 2.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.32 to 4.32) and duration of surgery (odds ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.05 to 1.73) were associated with 30-day readmission. CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to reduce readmissions should be directed at modifiable risk factors for surgical-site infection and other surgical complications, particularly among those with prior skin infections and longer durations of surgery.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tan, Shu Yun</author><author>Low, Lian Leng</author><author>Yang, Yong</author><author>Lee, Kheng Hock</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Applicability of a previously validated readmission predictive index in medical patients in Singapore: a retrospective study.</title><secondary-title>BMC health services research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC health services research</full-title></periodical><pages>366</pages><volume>13</volume><keywords><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Comorbidity</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Length of Stay</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Severity of Illness Index</keyword><keyword>Singapore</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>24074454</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1472-6963-13-366</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Hospital readmissions are serious and costly events, and readmission  rates are considered to be an indicator of quality in health care management. Several models to identify patients at risk of unplanned readmissions have been developed in Western countries, but little is known about their performance in other countries. This paper reports the possible utility of one such model developed in Canada, the LACE index, in patients in a tertiary hospital in Singapore. METHODS: We used administrative data from Singapore General Hospital for patients admitted between 1st January 2006 and 31st December 2010. Data such as demographic and clinical data including disease codes were extracted. The patient cohort was divided into two groups with a LACE index of 10 as the cutoff. Multivariate logistic regression analysis models were used to compare the outcomes between the two groups of patients with adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, year of discharge, intensive care unit admission, and admission ward class. RESULTS: Overall, 127 550 patients were eligible for analysis. Patients with a LACE index &gt;/= 10 had a higher risk of 30-day unplanned readmission after index discharge (odds ratio [OR]: 4.37; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.18-4.57). After adjustment, the risk remained significant (OR: 4.88; 95% CI: CI 4.57-5.22). The C-statistic for the adjusted model was 0.70 (P &lt; 0.001). Similar results were shown for 90-day unplanned readmission and emergency visits after the same adjustment. CONCLUSION: The use of the LACE index may have significant application in identifying medical patients at high risk of readmission and visits to the Emergency Department in Singapore.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Davies, Sheryl M</author><author>Saynina, Olga</author><author>McDonald, Kathryn M</author><author>Baker, Laurence C</author><author>S.M., Davies</author><author>O., Saynina</author><author>K.M., Mcdonald</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Limitations of using same-hospital readmission metrics</title><secondary-title>International Journal for Quality in Health Care</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal for Quality in Health Care</full-title></periodical><pages>633-639</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>*clinical assessment tool</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>80 and over</keyword><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>California</keyword><keyword>Data Interpretation</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis-Related Groups</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Health</keyword><keyword>Health Care</keyword><keyword>Hospitals</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Insurance</keyword><keyword>Logistic Models</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Medicare</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Quality Indicators</keyword><keyword>Risk Adjustment</keyword><keyword>Statistical</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>Young Adult</keyword><keyword>adult</keyword><keyword>aged</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>case mix</keyword><keyword>comorbidity</keyword><keyword>controlled study</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>heart surgery</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>logistic regression analysis</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>medicare</keyword><keyword>middle aged</keyword><keyword>priority journal</keyword><keyword>standards</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>very elderly</keyword><keyword>young adult</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><pub-location>S.M.

To quantify the limitations associated with restricting readmission metrics to same-hospital only readmission. Design. Using 2000-2009 California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development Patient Discharge Data Nonpublic file, we identified the proportion of 7-, 15-and 30-day readmissions occurring to the same hospital as the initial admission using All-cause Readmission (ACR) and 3M Corporation Potentially Preventable Readmissions (PPR) Metric. We examined the correlation between performance using same and different hospital readmission, the percent of hospitals remaining in the extreme deciles when utilizing different metrics, agreement in identifying outliers and differences in longitudinal performance. Using logistic regression, we examined the factors associated with admission to the same hospital. Results. 68% of 30-day ACR and 70% of 30-day PPR occurred to the same hospital. Abdominopelvic procedures had higher proportions of same-hospital readmissions (87.4-88.9%), cardiac surgery had lower (72.5-74.9%) and medical DRGs were lower than surgical DRGs (67.1 vs. 71.1%). Correlation and agreement in identifying high-and low-performing hospitals was weak to moderate, except for 7-day metrics where agreement was stronger (r = 0.23-0.80, Kappa = 0.38-0.76). Agreement for withinhospital significant (P &lt; 0.05) longitudinal change was weak (Kappa = 0.05-0.11). Beyond all patient refined-diagnostic related groups, payer was the most predictive factor with Medicare and MediCal patients having a higher likelihood of same-hospital readmission (OR 1.62, 1.73). Conclusions. Same-hospital readmission metrics are limited for all tested applications. Caution should be used when conducting research, quality improvement or comparative applications that do not account for readmissions to other hospitals. © The Author 2013.

Identifying high-risk patients and targeting intensive post-discharge interventions may help reduce readmissions. Thus, this study aims to develop and validate a predictive model to score patients' risk of emergency hospital readmission in an acute hospital in Singapore. METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study, data were collected for medical patients discharged from Alexandra Hospital between August 2011 and December 2011. We identified potential risk factors based on the variables used in the &quot;LACE&quot; index and &quot;HARRPE&quot; model. Using a split-sample design, we constructed logistic regression models to predict readmission or death within 30 days. A risk index was then developed to score the readmission risk using the methods described by Sullivan et al. The C-statistic was used to measure discriminative ability and the Hosmer- Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test was used for calibration. RESULTS: Of 3175 patient discharges, 20.3% were readmitted to hospital or died within 30 days of discharge. The variables independently associated with the outcome included admissions in previous one year, number of comorbidities, emergency department visits in previous six months and length of stay. The risk score was discriminative (C-statistics 0.763, 95% CI: 0.737-0.788) and accurate (Hosmer- Lemeshow statistic 11.46, p=0.177) at predicting outcome risk. The expected risk ranged from 4.3% (score 0) to 65.3% (score 18). The optimal cut-off score that maximized sensitivity and specificity was six. High-risk patients (score &gt;6) accounted for 32.0% of the sample, and had four times the risk of readmission or death within 30 days compared with other patients (score &lt;6). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide an evidence-based tool to enable the early identification of high-risk patients in Singapore. This can be embedded in electronic medical records to alert clinicians of high-risk patients who may require intensive postdischarge intervention to avoid readmission.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>P.R., Mudireddy</author><author>A., Tierney</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Unplanned readmissions in IBD patients: Predictive factors</title><secondary-title>Gastroenterology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Gastroenterology</full-title></periodical><pages>S616-S617</pages><volume>144</volume><issue>5 SUPPL. 1</issue><keywords><keyword>*gastrointestinal disease</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*human</keyword><keyword>*patient</keyword><keyword>Crohn disease</keyword><keyword>Fisher exact test</keyword><keyword>antibiotic agent</keyword><keyword>chi square test</keyword><keyword>clinical feature</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>electronic medical record</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>health care cost</keyword><keyword>hospital</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>inflammatory disease</keyword><keyword>insurance</keyword><keyword>leukocyte count</keyword><keyword>mental disease</keyword><keyword>mesalazine</keyword><keyword>morbidity</keyword><keyword>narcotic agent</keyword><keyword>prospective study</keyword><keyword>relapse</keyword><keyword>remission</keyword><keyword>statistical analysis</keyword><keyword>statistical significance</keyword><keyword>steroid</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>tobacco</keyword><keyword>ulcerative colitis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><pub-location>P.R.

Hospitalizations for exacerbations of IBD are common. It is unknown which factors are associated with unplanned readmissions in patients with IBD. The aim of this study was to determine the factors predictive with unplanned readmissions at 1-mos, 3- mos and 1-yr. Preliminary data was previously presented by our group [AJG 2012 (107) Suppl. 1 S655], however, this represents extensively updated novel data. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical records of our institution (three large academic hospitals in an urban setting) to identify consecutive patients discharged between Jan 2007 to Dec 2010 with primary discharge diagnosis of either ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD). Index admission was defined as first unplanned admission during this period. Readmission was defined as unplanned admission (due to any cause) occurring within 1 month, 3 months and 1 year from the index admission. In order to identify factors predictive of readmissions, we compared social, demographic and clinical features at index admission of patients with readmission and those with no readmissions. The following data was assessed: demographics (age, sex, race, insurance), tobacco use, source of admission (ED, transfer, direct admit), admitting service, type of IBD, years of disease, history of surgery prior to index admission, surgery during index admission, medications during index admission and at discharge (antibiotics, steroids, mesalamine, immunomodulators, biologics, narcotics), WBC count, use of TPN, ICU stay, history psychiatric illness, co-morbidities. The statistical analysis was done by chi square test and Fisher exact test. A p value ,0.05 was considered significant. Results: A total of 479 patients had an index admission with primary discharge diagnosis of either UC or CD during the study period. There were a total of 384 unplanned readmissions during the study period. The unplanned readmission rates were- 12.5% at 1 month, 23.4% at 3 mos, 38% at 1 yr. 299 of 479 consecutive patients were analyzed with the following demographic information: mean age 38 yrs, 55% were females, 67.5% were Whites, 107 patients had UC, 192 had CD, mean duration of IBD 10 yr. Please refer to tables 1 and 2 for results. Conclusions: Based on our results we conclude that the 1mos, 3mos and 1yr unplanned readmissions rates are high in IBD patients. Receiving TPN during index admission and LOS predicts 1-month readmission, LOS predicts 3 mos readmission, while receiving TPN, ICU stay, LOS and having Govt. insurance predicts 1 yr readmission. Since frequent admissions are indicators of poor quality of care, future prospective studies on large number of patients are needed to identify modifiable factors to prevent readmissions and thereby healthcare costs.

Background: Unplanned readmissions to hospital following ACS have worse outcomes, are costly and often preventable. Identifying a predictive tool to quantify the risk of readmission would help clinicians identify at risk patients. Methods: 246 patients admitted to hospital with ACS (NSTEMI&amp;STEMI) from July to November 2010were retrospectively assessed. Baseline characteristics, validated general readmission, bleeding and risk scores (LACE, CRUSADE &amp; CADDILAC and TIMI-NSTEMI respectively) were calculated. Receiver operative characteristic curve was performed for all the scores. Results: Conclusion: LACE score was a strong predictor of 30-day and 12-month readmission amongst the scored calculated in our cohort. Further studies are needed to assess the predictability of these scores in a larger population.

These 2 methods have not been directly compared in terms of how they identify high-performing and low-performing hospitals. OBJECTIVES: To examine how consistently the CMS and PPR methods identify performance outliers, and explore how the PPR preventability component impacts hospital readmission rates, public reporting on CMS' Hospital Compare website, and pay-for-performance under CMS' Hospital Readmission Reduction Program for 3 conditions (acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia). METHODS: We applied the CMS all-cause model and the PPR software to VA administrative data to calculate 30-day observed FY08-10 VA hospital readmission rates and hospital profiles. We then tested the effect of preventability on hospital readmission rates and outlier identification for reporting and pay-for-performance by replacing the dependent variable in the CMS all-cause model (Yes/No readmission) with the dichotomous PPR outcome (Yes/No preventable readmission). RESULTS: The CMS and PPR methods had moderate correlations in readmission rates for each condition. After controlling for all methodological differences but preventability, correlations increased to &gt;90%. The assessment of preventability yielded different outlier results for public reporting in 7% of hospitals; for 30% of hospitals there would be an impact on Hospital Readmission Reduction Program reimbursement rates. CONCLUSIONS: Despite uncertainty over which readmission measure is superior in evaluating hospital performance, we confirmed that there are differences in CMS-generated and PPR-generated hospital profiles for reporting and pay-for-performance, because of methodological differences and the PPR's preventability component.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Donzé, Jacques</author><author>Aujesky, Drahomir</author><author>Williams, Deborah</author><author>Schnipper, Jeffrey L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Potentially avoidable 30-day hospital readmissions in medical patients: derivation and validation of a prediction model.</title><secondary-title>JAMA internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JAMA internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>632-638</pages><volume>173</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>80 and over</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Algorithms</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Logistic Models</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Models</keyword><keyword>Patient Discharge</keyword><keyword>Patient Discharge: statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission: statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Theoretical</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23529115</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1001/jamainternmed.2013.3023</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23529115</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>IMPORTANCE: Because effective interventions to reduce hospital readmissions are often expensive to implement, a score to predict potentially avoidable readmissions may help target the patients most likely to benefit.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To derive and internally validate a prediction model for potentially avoidable 30-day hospital readmissions in medical patients using administrative and clinical data readily available prior to discharge.\n\nDESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.\n\nSETTING: Academic medical center in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nPARTICIPANTS: All patient discharges from any medical services between July 1, 2009, and June 30, 2010.\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Potentially avoidable 30-day readmissions to 3 hospitals of the Partners HealthCare network were identified using a validated computerized algorithm based on administrative data (SQLape). A simple score was developed using multivariable logistic regression, with two-thirds of the sample randomly selected as the derivation cohort and one-third as the validation cohort.\n\nRESULTS: Among 10 731 eligible discharges, 2398 discharges (22.3%) were followed by a 30-day readmission, of which 879 (8.5% of all discharges) were identified as potentially avoidable. The prediction score identified 7 independent factors, referred to as the HOSPITAL score: h emoglobin at discharge, discharge from an o ncology service, s odium level at discharge, p rocedure during the index admission, i ndex t ype of admission, number of a dmissions during the last 12 months, and l ength of stay. In the validation set, 26.7% of the patients were classified as high risk, with an estimated potentially avoidable readmission risk of 18.0% (observed, 18.2%). The HOSPITAL score had fair discriminatory power (C statistic, 0.71) and had good calibration.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This simple prediction model identifies before discharge the risk of potentially avoidable 30-day readmission in medical patients. This score has potential to easily identify patients who may need more intensive transitional care interventions.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>H., Chan</author><author>S., Waldman</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Risk of hospital readmission in orthopaedic trauma: Using electronic medical records to improve quality of care</title><secondary-title>Current Orthopaedic Practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Current Orthopaedic Practice</full-title></periodical><pages>453-454</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>*electronic medical record</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*human</keyword><keyword>*injury</keyword><keyword>*orthopedic surgeon</keyword><keyword>*risk</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>hospital</keyword><keyword>infection</keyword><keyword>obesity</keyword><keyword>open fracture</keyword><keyword>patient</keyword><keyword>prediction</keyword><keyword>risk factor</keyword><keyword>smoking</keyword><keyword>tibia shaft fracture</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><pub-location>H.

URR affects 7- 24% of colorectal surgery (CRS) patients and decreases patient satisfaction, increases healthcare costs, and is a quality indicator. Using only EHR data available prior to discharge and readmission data from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (NSQIP), we wished to create models for predicting readmission suitable for realtime use. Methods: We developed a GI surgery data warehouse including data from EHR and NSQIP. Major colorectal surgery encounters from January 2011 to June 2012 were included. Encounters were randomly partitioned into training and testing sets. Numerous predictive analytic algorithms were used for model generation. Model accuracy, predictive confidence, and other features were examined. Results: There were 375 encounters with a 16%, 30- day URR rate. The encounters were randomly partitioned into 80% training cases and 20% test cases for modeling. The predictor variables used included age, sex, ethnicity, zip code, surgical Apgar score, preoperative hemoglobin, last recorded hemoglobin during encounter, estimated blood loss, transfusion volume, ASA, surgeon, and BMI. From numerous modeling algorithms, using repeated random sub-sampling cross-validation, a Naive Bayes classifier model was found to perform best to predict URR. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the best-performing model were 91%, 94%, and 73%, respectively. Conclusions: In a CRS population, URR may be identified using discretely available EHR data, or simple transformations of it, prior to discharge through use of predictive analytic techniques. When incorporated into a clinical decision management system, it may allow for improved targeting of resources to high-risk patients and reduce readmissions. Prospective evaluation with intervention will be required for validation.

As a cardiac centre we have reviewed emergency readmissions in order to redesign services to try and reduce avoidable readmissions. Methods: A notes review of 39 patients admitted as an emergency within 30 days of an elective spell (28 cardiology and 11 cardiac surgery) over a 3 month period provided an overview of why patients were being readmitted. As a result cardiology pathways were redeveloped in the first instance. Following the redesign, 79 patient calls to the Cardiac Care Unit (CCU), over a 3 month period, were audited resulting in further changes. Results: The initial audit found a high level of clinical coding accuracy; however initial patient registration issues were highlighted. In over half of all patients the readmission was unlinked to their elective spell. Of the linked readmissions 4 had groin related problems and others included further chest pain and further arrhythmias. Post cardiac surgery patients readmitted with recognised complications such as wound infections, chest infections, atrial fibrillation, and pleural effusions. 54% (n = 21) of all patients were readmitted within the first week of discharge. Changes were implemented to the cardiology pathways: 1. Patient discharge advice sheets were updated to provide CCU as the contact for post procedure concerns. Calls were triaged and expert advice provided by the nurses. 2. A groin pathway was developed. 3. Clerical recording was improved. The patient calls to CCU were audited. On average there was one call / day to CCU. 44% (n = 35) were related to the groin with 75% being resolved with telephone advice with some recurring concerns about the wound site. 7 patients (19%) were reviewed on the ward, but their outcome was unknown from this audit. 2 patients (6%) were advised to go to A&amp;E. 10% of calls were related to pain, with 63% of these satisfied with telephone support. 6% were related to medication - all resolved on the telephone. 22% of calls were deemed unrelated to their procedure or initial complaint. Further updates to the discharge sheets have been made as a result. A proforma for ward attendees has been developed, along with a GP letter template. A formal reaudit of readmissions will follow to assess the impact of changes. Conclusions: In depth notes review of readmitted patients and subsequently reviewing the calls that concerned patients make following discharge has allowed themes to be picked up and patient pathways to be improved.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lichtman, Judith H</author><author>Leifheit-Limson, Erica C</author><author>Jones, Sara B</author><author>Wang, Yun</author><author>Goldstein, Larry B</author><author>J.H., Lichtman</author><author>E.C., Leifheit-Limson</author><author>S.B., Jones</author><author>Y., Wang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Preventable readmissions within 30 days of ischemic stroke among Medicare beneficiaries.</title><secondary-title>Stroke</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Stroke</full-title></periodical><pages>3429-3435</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>*cerebrovascular accident/dm [Disease Management]</keyword><keyword>*cerebrovascular accident/pc [Prevention]</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*medicare</keyword><keyword>80 and over</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Brain Ischemia</keyword><keyword>Fee-for-Service Plans</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Health Care</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>ICD-9-CM</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Medicare</keyword><keyword>Outcome Assessment (Health Care)</keyword><keyword>Pacific Ocean</keyword><keyword>Patient Discharge</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Quality Indicators</keyword><keyword>Stroke</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Q</keyword><keyword>adult</keyword><keyword>aged</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>brain ischemia/di [Diagnosis]</keyword><keyword>brain ischemia/dm [Disease Management]</keyword><keyword>comorbidity</keyword><keyword>controlled study</keyword><keyword>economics</keyword><keyword>health care</keyword><keyword>health care cost</keyword><keyword>health care quality</keyword><keyword>hospital patient</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>major clinical study</keyword><keyword>medicaid</keyword><keyword>medical fee</keyword><keyword>outcome assessment</keyword><keyword>pneumonia</keyword><keyword>predictor variable</keyword><keyword>priority journal</keyword><keyword>prospective payment</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><pub-location>J.H.

The proportion of poststroke readmissions that is potentially preventable is unknown. METHODS - Thirty-day readmissions for all Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged &gt;65 years discharged alive with a primary diagnosis of ischemic stroke (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification 433, 434, 436) between December 2005 and November 2006 were analyzed. Preventable readmissions were identified based on 14 Prevention Quality Indicators developed for use with administrative data by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. National, hospital-level, and regional preventable readmission rates were estimated. Random-effects logistic regression was also used to determine patient-level factors associated with preventable readmissions. RESULTS - Among 307 887 ischemic stroke discharges, 44 379 (14.4%) were readmitted within 30 days; 5322 (1.7% of all discharges) were the result of a preventable cause (eg, pneumonia), and 39 057 (12.7%) were for other reasons (eg, cancer). In multivariate analysis, older age and cardiovascular-related comorbid conditions were strong predictors of preventable readmissions. Preventable readmission rates were highest in the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, and US territories and lowest in the Mountain and Pacific regions. CONCLUSIONS - On the basis of Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Prevention Quality Indicators, we found that a small proportion of readmissions after ischemic stroke were classified as preventable. Although other causes of readmissions not reflected in the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality measures could also be avoidable, hospital-level programs intended to reduce all-cause readmissions and costs should target high-risk patients. © 2013 American Heart Association, Inc.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hechenbleikner, Elizabeth M</author><author>Makary, Martin A</author><author>Samarov, Daniel V</author><author>Bennett, Jennifer L</author><author>Gearhart, Susan L</author><author>Efron, Jonathan E</author><author>Wick, Elizabeth C</author><author>E.M., Hechenbleikner</author><author>M.A., Makary</author><author>D.V., Samarov</author><author>J.L., Bennett</author><author>S.L., Gearhart</author><author>J.E., Efron</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hospital readmission by method of data collection.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American College of Surgeons</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American College of Surgeons</full-title></periodical><pages>1150-1158</pages><volume>216</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>*data collection method</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>80 and over</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Colectomy</keyword><keyword>Colorectal Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Data Collection</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Health Care</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Medical Records</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Quality Indicators</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Young Adult</keyword><keyword>adult</keyword><keyword>aged</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>colorectal cancer/su [Surgery]</keyword><keyword>colorectal surgery</keyword><keyword>dehydration/co [Complication]</keyword><keyword>diverticulitis/su [Surgery]</keyword><keyword>enteritis/su [Surgery]</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>major clinical study</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>medical record review</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>patient care</keyword><keyword>priority journal</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>surgical infection/co [Complication]</keyword><keyword>surgical patient</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><pub-location>E.C.

We hypothesized that readmission rates, readmissions related to index admission, and potentially unnecessary readmissions vary by data collection method for surgical patients. STUDY DESIGN: Using 3 different data collection methods, we compared 30-day unplanned readmission rates and potentially unnecessary readmissions among colorectal surgery patients at a single institution between July 2009 and November 2011. We compared the NSQIP clinical reviewer method, the University HealthSystem Consortium (UHC) administrative billing data method, and physician medical record review. RESULTS: Seven hundred and thirty-five colorectal surgery patients were identified with readmission rates as follows: NSQIP 14.6% (107 of 735) vs UHC 17.6% (129 of 735). The NSQIP method identified 9 readmissions not found in billing records because the readmission occurred at another hospital (n = 7) or due to a discrepancy in definition (n = 2). The UHC method identified 31 readmissions not identified by NSQIP because of a broader readmission definition (n = 20) or were missed by reviewers (n = 11). The NSQIP method identified 72% of readmissions as related to index admission and physician chart review identified 83%. The UHC method identified 51% of readmissions as related to index admission and physician chart review identified 86%. Sixty-six of 129 UHC readmissions (51%) were deemed potentially preventable; based on physician chart review, 112 of 129 readmissions (87%) were deemed clinically necessary at the time of presentation. Most readmissions were due to surgical site infections (46 of 129 [36%]) and dehydration (30 of 129 [23%]). With improved patient-care efforts, 41 of 129 (31.8%) complications might not have required readmission. CONCLUSIONS: Readmission rates and unnecessary readmissions vary depending on data collection methodology. Reimbursements based on readmission should use standardized and fair methods to minimize perverse incentives that penalize hospitals for appropriate care of high-risk surgical patients.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McCormack, Richard</author><author>Michels, Ryan</author><author>Ramos, Nicholas</author><author>Hutzler, Lorraine</author><author>Slover, James D</author><author>Bosco, Joseph A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Thirty-day readmission rates as a measure of quality: causes of readmission after orthopedic surgeries and accuracy of administrative data.</title><secondary-title>Journal of Healthcare Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Healthcare Management</full-title></periodical><pages>64-76</pages><volume>58</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Databases</keyword><keyword>Factual</keyword><keyword>Health Care</keyword><keyword>Hospitals</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Medical Records</keyword><keyword>New York</keyword><keyword>Orthopedics</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Postoperative Complications</keyword><keyword>Quality Indicators</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>University</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>standards</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>1096-9012</isbn><accession-num>23424819</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=emed11&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=2014147813</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The rate of unplanned 30-day readmissions to the hospital after discharge is being used as a marker to compare the quality of care across hospitals and to set reimbursement levels for care. While the readmission rate can be reported using administrative data, the accuracy of these data is variable, and defining which readmissions are unplanned and preventable is often difficult. The purpose of this study was to review readmissions to a single orthopedic hospital to identify the causes for readmission and, in particular, which readmissions are planned versus unplanned. Using that hospital's administrative database of patient records from 2007 to 2009, we identified all patients who were readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of a previous hospitalization for a procedure. Readmissions were broadly categorized as planned (a staged or rescheduled procedure or a direct transfer) or unplanned. Unplanned readmissions were defined as either surgical or nonsurgical complications (medical conditions not directly related to the procedure). Almost 30 percent of readmissions were planned. Of the unplanned readmissions, close to 60 percent were triggered by an infection or a concern for an infection. Nonsurgical complications accounted for 18.2 percent of unplanned readmissions. This study highlights the importance of careful data collection and abstraction when calculating early readmission rates. Preventing surgical site infection and better coordinating care between orthopedic surgeons and primary care and medical subspecialty physicians may significantly reduce readmission rates.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Davies, Sheryl</author><author>Saynina, Olga</author><author>Schultz, Ellen</author><author>McDonald, Kathryn M</author><author>Baker, Laurence C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Implications of metric choice for common applications of readmission metrics</title><secondary-title>Health Services Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Health Services Research</full-title></periodical><pages>1978-1995</pages><volume>48</volume><issue>6 PART1</issue><keywords><keyword>Benchmarking</keyword><keyword>California</keyword><keyword>Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (U.S.)</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Myocardial Infarction</keyword><keyword>Patient Discharge</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Pneumonia</keyword><keyword>Quality of Health Care</keyword><keyword>Risk Adjustment</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>organization &amp; administration</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>therapy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><pub-location>S.

DATA SOURCES: 2000-2009 California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development Patient Discharge Data Nonpublic file. STUDY DESIGN: We calculated 30-day readmission rates using three metrics, for three disease groups: heart failure (HF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and pneumonia. Using each metric, we calculated the absolute change and correlation between performance; the percent of hospitals remaining in extreme deciles and level of agreement; and differences in longitudinal performance. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Average hospital rates for HF patients and the CMS metric were generally higher than for other conditions and metrics. Correlations between the ACR and CMS metrics were highest (r = 0.67-0.84). Rates calculated using the PPR and either ACR or CMS metrics were moderately correlated (r = 0.50-0.67). Between 47 and 75 percent of hospitals in an extreme decile according to one metric remained when using a different metric. Correlations among metrics were modest when measuring hospital longitudinal change. CONCLUSIONS: Different approaches to computing readmissions can produce different hospital rankings and impact pay-for-performance. Careful consideration should be placed on readmission metric choice for these applications.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lucas, Donald J</author><author>Pawlik, Timothy M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Readmission after surgery.</title><secondary-title>Advances in surgery</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Advances in surgery</full-title></periodical><pages>185-199</pages><volume>48</volume><keywords><keyword>Comorbidity</keyword><keyword>Health Policy</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Length of Stay</keyword><keyword>Medicare</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Postoperative Complications</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>economics</keyword><keyword>legislation &amp; jurisprudence</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>25293615</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.yasu.2014.05.009</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Readmission is a large problem after both medical and surgical admissions. Recent policy changes that include substantial financial penalties have made readmission an important, if not the most important, pay-for-performance program for health care in the United States. The CMS Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program currently applies only to patients with certain medical diagnoses, but it is expanding into orthopedic surgery in 2014, and will likely involve more surgical procedures in the future. Accordingly, hospitals and researchers will increasingly be focused on understanding and preventing readmission. Definitions of readmission must be standardized between organizations to allow for comparison. The accepted definition for any organization tracking rehospitalization should be 30-day all-cause readmission. In addition, any hospital profiling applications or studies comparing readmission rates between hospitals should use hierarchical rather than standard logistic regression modeling. Rather than relying on findings from medical patients, further studies on the specific causes of readmission after surgery should be conducted. Predictive modeling has some utility in focusing readmission prevention efforts on high-risk patients, but understanding the underlying causes of readmission is key to designing effective prevention interventions. Current evidence suggests that postoperative complications play a key role in surgical readmission, but efforts on improving discharge planning and coordination of care developed in medical patients will also be critical in decreasing unnecessary readmissions in the future.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lavenberg, Julia G</author><author>Leas, Brian</author><author>Umscheid, Craig A</author><author>Williams, Kendal</author><author>Goldmann, David R</author><author>Kripalani, Sunil</author><author>J.G., Lavenberg</author><author>B., Leas</author><author>C.A., Umscheid</author><author>K., Williams</author><author>D.R., Goldmann</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessing preventability in the quest to reduce hospital readmissions</title><secondary-title>Journal of hospital medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of hospital medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>598-603</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>*government</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*procedures</keyword><keyword>Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (U.S.)</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Outcome Assessment (Health Care)</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>outcome assessment</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><accession-num>24961204</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jhm.2226</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=emed13&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=24961204</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Hospitals devote significant human and capital resources to eliminate hospital readmissions, prompted most recently by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) financial penalties for higher-than-expected readmission rates. Implicit in these efforts are assumptions that a significant proportion of readmissions are preventable, and preventable readmissions can be identified. Yet, no consensus exists in the literature regarding methods to determine which readmissions are reasonably preventable. In this article, we examine strengths and limitations of the CMS readmission metric, explore how preventable readmissions have been defined and measured, and discuss implications for readmission reduction efforts. Drawing on our clinical, research and operational experiences, we offer suggestions to address the key challenges in moving forward to measure and reduce preventable readmissions.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M, Subramanian Souphis</author><author>R, Sylvester</author><author>A, Wiles</author><author>M, Subramanian Souphis</author><author>W, Froehlich</author><author>L, Gordon</author><author>T, Alexandris-Souphis</author><author>E, Kline-Rogers</author><author>P, Vaishnava</author><author>M, Rubenfire</author><author>M., Souphis Subramanian</author><author>R., Sylvester</author><author>A., Wiles</author><author>M., Souphis Subramanian</author><author>W., Froehlich</author><author>L., Gordon</author><author>T., Alexandris-Souphis</author><author>E., Kline-Rogers</author><author>P., Vaishnava</author><author>M., Rubenfire</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Readmission avoidability in acute coronary syndrome patients</title><secondary-title>Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes</full-title></periodical><pages>no pagination-no pagination</pages><volume>7</volume><keywords><keyword>*acute coronary syndrome</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*human</keyword><keyword>*medical society</keyword><keyword>*outcomes research</keyword><keyword>*patient</keyword><keyword>adverse drug reaction</keyword><keyword>cardiac patient</keyword><keyword>cardiologist</keyword><keyword>consensus</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>disease course</keyword><keyword>emergency care</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>hospital</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>medicare</keyword><keyword>neoplasm</keyword><keyword>population</keyword><keyword>thorax pain</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><pub-location>M.

According to Medicare 13.4% of AMI admissions were followed by a rehospitalization within 15 days. A 2007 MedPAC report declared 76% of 30-day readmissions preventable. These rates are used as quality indicators despite lack of consensus on the definition of avoidable and unavoidable readmissions. We sought to define these terms and to analyze the effect of these definitions on 30-day outcomes. Methods: BRIDGE (Bridging the Discharge Gap Effectively) is an NP-led transitional care program for cardiac patients within 14 days of discharge. Retrospective data were abstracted on ACS patients readmitted before their appointments between 2008-2010. All readmissions were characterized as avoidable or unavoidable. Definitions were developed from the literature and in concert with senior cardiologists. Avoidable readmission was defined as being the result of a patient or provider issue that if managed may have prevented the admission. Unavoidable readmissions were defined as a patient in need of acute care. Avoidability status was further divided as related or unrelated to the index diagnosis. Results: Of 1188 BRIDGE referrals 304 (25.6%) experienced ACS events. In comparison to the total ACS population, patients readmitted before their BRIDGE clinic appointment (BC) (n=21, 6.9%) tended to be older, female, and were less likely to have a history of a cath or AMI (Table 1). In this study, 81% (n=17) of early readmissions were deemed unavoidable and most (n=14, 66.7%) were attributed to non-ACS issues or disease progression. These unavoidable readmissions included patients with cancer complications, chest pain, or other non-related diagnoses. Only 19% (n=4) of the readmissions were declared avoidable as a result of patient lack of adherence or provider issues such as adverse drug effects. Conclusion: The majority of early (before BC) readmissions following an index hospitalization for ACS patients referred to BRIDGE were unavoidable and unrelated to ACS. A clear discrepancy is seen between the 76% preventable readmissions in the MedPAC report and the 19% preventable readmissions in this study. Distinctions between unavoidable and avoidable readmissions should inform the utility of 30-day readmission rates as quality metrics.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>L., Findlay</author><author>L, Findlay</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rates of avoidable readmissions in emergency surgery at a district general hospital</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Surgery</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Surgery</full-title></periodical><pages>S88-S88</pages><volume>12</volume><keywords><keyword>*emergency surgery</keyword><keyword>*general hospital</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*human</keyword><keyword>*surgeon</keyword><keyword>analgesia</keyword><keyword>antibiotic agent</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>follow up</keyword><keyword>gallstone</keyword><keyword>general surgery</keyword><keyword>health statistics</keyword><keyword>hospital bed</keyword><keyword>hospital patient</keyword><keyword>infection</keyword><keyword>medical audit</keyword><keyword>pain</keyword><keyword>patient</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><pub-location>L.

Following a 25% cut in surgical beds at a busy district general hospital, we audited emergency surgery readmission rates. Methods: Data were collected over six months (August 2012-February 2013). 120 readmissions were identified. A standard of 9% readmissions within 28 days of discharge was set based on Department of Health statistics for national general surgery readmissions (2008). Readmissions were classified as potentially avoidable or non-avoidable. Avoidable readmissions were further categorised by reason for readmission. Results: Readmission rates were consistently below the audit standard (5.8%). However, 53.4% of readmissions with recurrent symptoms and 57% with complications of treatment were potentially avoidable. 33% of patients readmitted were not given a definitive diagnosis on initial admission. Missed diagnosis prevented 10% from receiving definitive treatment on first admission. Significant avoidable causes included incomplete treatment of infection, lack of definitive treatment of gallstones, and mismanagement of post-operative pain. Older patients were more likely to be readmitted and readmission within 48 hours was most common. Conclusions: Readmissions may be predicted and potentially avoided. Timely follow-up, urgent-elective surgical treatment and appropriate antibiotic and analgesia prescribing may reduce readmission.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jackson, Ana H</author><author>Fireman, Emily</author><author>Feigenbaum, Paul</author><author>Neuwirth, Estee</author><author>Kipnis, Patricia</author><author>Bellows, Jim</author><author>A.H., Jackson</author><author>E., Fireman</author><author>P., Feigenbaum</author><author>E., Neuwirth</author><author>P., Kipnis</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Manual and automated methods for identifying potentially preventable readmissions: a comparison in a large healthcare system</title><secondary-title>BMC medical informatics and decision making</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC medical informatics and decision making</full-title></periodical><pages>28</pages><volume>14</volume><keywords><keyword>*health care delivery</keyword><keyword>*health care quality</keyword><keyword>*hospital information system</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>California</keyword><keyword>Delivery of Health Care</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Health Care</keyword><keyword>Hospital Information Systems</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Qualitative Research</keyword><keyword>Quality Assurance</keyword><keyword>Sensitivity and Specificity</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>aged</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>comparative study</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>methodology</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>qualitative research</keyword><keyword>sensitivity and specificity</keyword><keyword>standard</keyword><keyword>standards</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><pub-location>A.H.

Little is known about the concordance of these methods. METHODS: We manually reviewed 459 30-day, all-cause readmissions at 18 Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospitals, determining potential preventability through a four-step manual review process that included a chart review tool, interviews with patients, their families, and treating providers, and nurse reviewer and physician evaluation of findings and determination of preventability on a five-point scale. We reassessed the same readmissions with 3 M's Potentially Preventable Readmission (PPR) software. We examined between-method agreement and the specificity and sensitivity of the PPR software using manual review as the reference. RESULTS: Automated classification and manual review respectively identified 78% (358) and 47% (227) of readmissions as potentially preventable. Overall, the methods agreed about the preventability of 56% (258) of readmissions. Using manual review as the reference, the sensitivity of PPR was 85% and specificity was 28%. CONCLUSIONS: Concordance between methods was not high enough to replace manual review with automated classification as the primary method of identifying preventable 30-day, all-cause readmission for quality improvement purposes.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fischer, Claudia</author><author>Lingsma, Hester F</author><author>Marang-van de Mheen, Perla J</author><author>Kringos, Dionne S</author><author>Klazinga, Niek S</author><author>Steyerberg, Ewout W</author><author>C., Fischer</author><author>H.F., Lingsma</author><author>P.J., Marang-van de Mheen</author><author>D.S., Kringos</author><author>N.S., Klazinga</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Is the readmission rate a valid quality indicator?

However, the validity of readmission rates as a measure of quality of hospital care is not evident. We aimed to give an overview of the different methodological aspects in the definition and measurement of readmission rates that need to be considered when interpreting readmission rates as a reflection of quality of care. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review, using the bibliographic databases Embase, Medline OvidSP, Web-of-Science, Cochrane central and PubMed for the period of January 2001 to May 2013. RESULTS: The search resulted in 102 included papers. We found that definition of the context in which readmissions are used as a quality indicator is crucial. This context includes the patient group and the specific aspects of care of which the quality is aimed to be assessed. Methodological flaws like unreliable data and insufficient case-mix correction may confound the comparison of readmission rates between hospitals. Another problem occurs when the basic distinction between planned and unplanned readmissions cannot be made. Finally, the multi-faceted nature of quality of care and the correlation between readmissions and other outcomes limit the indicator's validity. CONCLUSIONS: Although readmission rates are a promising quality indicator, several methodological concerns identified in this study need to be addressed, especially when the indicator is intended for accountability or pay for performance. We recommend investing resources in accurate data registration, improved indicator description, and bundling outcome measures to provide a more complete picture of hospital care.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rosen, Amy K</author><author>Chen, Qi</author><author>Shin, Marlena H</author><author>O'Brien, William</author><author>Shwartz, Michael</author><author>Mull, Hillary J</author><author>Cevasco, Marisa</author><author>Borzecki, Ann M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Medical and surgical readmissions in the Veterans Health Administration: what proportion are related to the index hospitalization?</title><secondary-title>Medical care</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Medical care</full-title></periodical><pages>243-249</pages><volume>52</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>*government</keyword><keyword>*health care quality</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*veterans health</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Comorbidity</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Health Care</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Length of Stay</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Patient Discharge</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Quality Indicators</keyword><keyword>Quality of Health Care</keyword><keyword>Socioeconomic Factors</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>United States Department of Veterans Affairs</keyword><keyword>adult</keyword><keyword>aged</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>chronic obstructive lung disease</keyword><keyword>comorbidity</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>health care quality</keyword><keyword>hospital discharge</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>major clinical study</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>medical care</keyword><keyword>middle aged</keyword><keyword>outcome assessment</keyword><keyword>outcome variable</keyword><keyword>postoperative complication/co [Complication]</keyword><keyword>priority journal</keyword><keyword>socioeconomics</keyword><keyword>statistics</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>total quality management</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><pub-location>A.K.

However, the extent to which medical or surgical readmissions reflect quality of care is largely unknown, because of the complexity of factors related to readmission. Identifying those readmissions that are clinically related to the index hospitalization is an important first step in closing this knowledge gap. The aims of this study were to examine unplanned readmissions in the Veterans Health Administration, identify clinically related versus unrelated unplanned readmissions, and compare the leading reasons for unplanned readmission between medical and surgical discharges. We classified 2,069,804 Veterans Health Administration hospital discharges (Fiscal Years 2003-2007) into medical/surgical index discharges with/without readmissions per their diagnosis-related groups. Our outcome variable was &quot;all-cause&quot; 30-day unplanned readmission. We compared medical and surgical unplanned readmissions (n=217,767) on demographics, clinical characteristics, and readmission reasons using descriptive statistics. Among all unplanned readmissions, 41.5% were identified as clinically related. Not surprisingly, heart failure (10.2%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (6.5%) were the top 2 reasons for clinically related readmissions among medical discharges; postoperative complications (ie, complications of surgical procedures and medical care or complications of devices) accounted for 70.5% of clinically related readmissions among surgical discharges. Although almost 42% of unplanned readmissions were identified as clinically related, the majority of unplanned readmissions were unrelated to the index hospitalization. Quality improvement interventions targeted at processes of care associated with the index hospitalization are likely to be most effective in reducing clinically related readmissions. It is less clear how to reduce nonclinically related readmissions; these may involve broader factors than inpatient care.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>H., Kim</author><author>W.W., Hung</author><author>M.C., Paik</author><author>J.S., Ross</author><author>Z., Zhao</author><author>G.-S., Kim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Predictors and outcomes of unplanned readmission to a different hospital</title><secondary-title>International Journal for Quality in Health Care</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal for Quality in Health Care</full-title></periodical><pages>513-519</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>*different hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*outcome assessment</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>adult</keyword><keyword>age</keyword><keyword>aged</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>causal modeling</keyword><keyword>emergency ward</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>gender</keyword><keyword>health care quality</keyword><keyword>hospital care</keyword><keyword>hospital cost</keyword><keyword>hospital discharge</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>lowest income group</keyword><keyword>major clinical study</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>middle aged</keyword><keyword>mortality</keyword><keyword>population research</keyword><keyword>priority journal</keyword><keyword>secondary analysis</keyword><keyword>very elderly</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>H.

Design: A population-based, secondary analysis using multilevel causal modeling. Setting: Acute care hospitals in California in the USA. Participants: In total, 509 775 patients aged 50 or older who were discharged alive from acute care hospitals (index hospitalizations), and 59 566 who had a rehospitalization within 30 days following their index discharge. Intervention: No intervention. Main Outcome Measures(s): Thirty-day unplanned readmissions to a different hospital compared with the same hospital and also the costs and health outcomes of the readmissions. Results: Twenty-one percent of patients with a rehospitalization had a different-hospital readmission. Compared with the same-hospital readmission group, the different-hospital readmission group was more likely to be younger, male and have a lower income. The index hospitals of the different-hospital readmission group were more likely to be smaller, for-profit hospitals, which were also more likely to be located in counties with higher competition. The different-hospital readmission group had higher odds for in-hospital death (8.1 vs. 6.7%; P &lt; 0.0001) and greater readmission hospital costs ($15 671.8 vs. $14 286.4; P &lt; 0.001) than the same-hospital readmission group. Conclusions: Patient, hospital and market characteristics predicted different-hospital readmissions compared with same-hospital readmissions. Mortality and cost outcomes were worse among patients with different-hospital readmissions. Strategies for better care coordination targeting people at risk for different-hospital readmissions are necessary.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>P.R., Mudireddy</author><author>F.I., Scott</author><author>A., Feathers</author><author>A., Tierney</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Predictors of early and late unplanned re-admissions in IBD patients</title><secondary-title>Gastroenterology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Gastroenterology</full-title></periodical><pages>S262-S263</pages><volume>148</volume><issue>4 SUPPL. 1</issue><keywords><keyword>*gastrointestinal disease</keyword><keyword>*human</keyword><keyword>*patient</keyword><keyword>Black person</keyword><keyword>Fisher exact test</keyword><keyword>Student t test</keyword><keyword>clinical feature</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>electronic medical record</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>government</keyword><keyword>health care</keyword><keyword>health care cost</keyword><keyword>hospital</keyword><keyword>hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>inflammatory disease</keyword><keyword>insurance</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>prospective study</keyword><keyword>relapse</keyword><keyword>remission</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>P.R.

Hospitalizations for exacerbations of IBD are common. It is unknown which factors are associated with unplanned readmissions in patients with IBD. The aim of this study was to determine the factors predictive of unplanned readmissions at 1-mon, 3-mons and 1-yr. Pr e l imina ry dat a was pr evious ly pr es ented by our group [Ga st roente rology 2013,Vol.144,(5),S-616-617], however, this represents extensively updated novel data. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical records of our institution (three large academic hospitals) to identify consecutive patients discharged between Jan 2007 to Dec 2010 with primary discharge diagnosis of either UC or CD. Index admission was defined as first unplanned admission during this period. Readmission was defined as unplanned admission (due to any cause) occurring within 1 mon, 3 mons and 1 yr from the index admission. In order to identify factors predictive of readmissions, we compared social, demographic and clinical features at index admission of patients with readmission and those with no readmissions (Table 1 includes a partial list of variables assessed). Chi squared tests, t-tests and fisher exact tests were conducted to identify factors predictive of readmissions. Variables with univariate significance of less than 0.1 were included in the multivariate models. Only variables with significance less than 0.15 were retained in the final models. Model significance was assessed using the likelihood ratio chi-square statistic. Results: A total of 439 index admissions with primary discharge diagnosis of either UC or CD were eligible for inclusion in the study. These patients accounted for a total of 785 admissions to the health system during the study period. The unplanned readmission rates were- 14% at 1-mon, 23.7% at 3-mons, 39.2% at 1 yr. Demographics of the study cohort were: mean age 38 yrs, 55% females, 68% Whites, 144 had UC, 295 had CD, mean duration of IBD 10 yrs. Median LOS of pts with readmissions (6 days) was significantly longer than those without readmissions (5 days) at 1 months, 3 months and 1 yr (p=0.0001, p=0.003, p=0.003 respectively). Please refer to tables for the results. Conclusions: Based on our results we conclude that the rates of 1-month, 3-month and 1-yr unplanned readmissions rates are high in IBD patients. Receiving TPN, ICU stay predicted both early and late readmissions, while male sex, black race, having a government insurance and outside hospital transfers predicted 1 yr readmission. Being discharged on biologics was protective against 3-mons readmission. Since frequent admissions are indicators of poor quality of care, future prospective studies on large number of patients are needed to identify modifiable factors to prevent readmissions and thereby reduce healthcare costs.

Fewer than 50% of patients have care coordinated with their primary care providers within two weeks of discharge. The LACE index is a validated tool, and its score has been used in literature to stratify patients at high risk of 30-day readmission. However, LACE doesn't predict the risk of medication- related readmission. This is a limitation, since two-thirds of adverse events after hospital discharge are attributed to medications, leading to increased costs in healthcare. Comprehensive medication management (CMM) has been shown to improve patient outcomes and decrease avoidable readmissions. This quality improvement initiative aims to leverage CMM to reduce readmissions in high-risk discharged patients taking multiple medications. METHODS: To facilitate care transitions, HealthEast Care System implemented a process at discharge that directs patients with LACE &gt;10 to Care Management and Clinic Coordinators to facilitate appointments with providers and pharmacists in clinic 3-7 days after discharge. The scope of this project was to impact care in patients with a LACE score &lt;10. Discharge data was evaluated from one HealthEast hospital from 7/2015 to 9/2015. This data calculated the percent of patients readmitted by number of medications and LACE score. RESULTS: Globally, readmission rates increased as the number of medications at discharge increased. 54% of patients were discharged with &gt; 5 medications and LACE of 5-9 compared to 19% with LACE &gt;10. CONCLUSION: This preliminary data builds on using the LACE score alone to identify patients at risk of readmission. A new process will be implemented where patients discharged with a LACE score of 5-9 taking &gt; 5 medications will be referred to pharmacists in primary care for CMM. We will evaluate the impact of this expanded process on readmission.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>P.R., Mudireddy</author><author>F.I., Scott</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Unplanned hospital readmission: Rates and causes in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: A critical analysis</title><secondary-title>Gastroenterology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Gastroenterology</full-title></periodical><pages>S835</pages><volume>148</volume><issue>4 SUPPL. 1</issue><keywords><keyword>*gastrointestinal disease</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*human</keyword><keyword>*inflammatory bowel disease</keyword><keyword>*patient</keyword><keyword>data base</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>electronic medical record</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>gastroenterology</keyword><keyword>health care</keyword><keyword>hospital</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>infection</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>marker</keyword><keyword>pain</keyword><keyword>risk factor</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>P.R.

Readmission has been deemed a marker of poor quality of care. The aim of the study was to better characterize the rates of unplanned readmissions in IBD patients at 1 month, 3 months and 1 year and to identify the reasons for the unplanned readmissions. Preliminary data was previously presented by our group [Gastroenterology 2013, Vol.144(5),S629], however, this presentation represents extensively updated new data and novel findings. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical record database of our institution (3 large urban academic hospitals) to identify consecutive patients admitted between Jan 2007 to Dec 2010 with a primary discharge diagnosis of either UC or CD. Index admission was defined as first unplanned admission with primary discharge diagnosis of either UC or CD. Readmission was defined as unplanned admission (due to any cause) occurring within 1-mon, 3-mons, or 1-yr from the index admission. Planned readmissions were excluded. Data analyzed included demographics, type of IBD, length of stay, and primary discharge diagnosis for both index admission and readmissions. Results: A total of 439 index admissions with primary discharge diagnosis of IBD were eligible for inclusion in the study. These patients accounted for a total of 785 admissions to the health system during the study period. The unplanned readmission rates were 14.1% at 1 month, 23.7% at 3 months, and 39.2% at 1-yr. Demographics of the study cohort were: mean age 38 yrs, 55% females, 68% Whites, 144 had UC, 295 had CD, mean duration of IBD 10 yrs. Among the 62 patients readmitted at least once in 1 month, 22 were readmitted within 1 week (1 week readmission rate of 5%). The median LOS for pts with readmissions was 7 days versus 5 days for those without readmission. Causes of readmissions are summarized in Tables 1. At 1-month, 52% of pts were readmitted with IBD as their primary discharge diagnosis (39/69). Among non-IBD discharge diagnosis, infection accounted for most readmissions (17%,12/69). A total of 172 pts were readmitted at least once within 1-yr of discharge. The median LOS for pts with readmissions was 6 days versus 5 days for those without readmission. Causes of readmissions are summarized in Table 2. At 1-yr, IBD was the discharge diagnosis for 47% of readmissions (162/346). Among non-IBD related discharge diagnosis, infection (15.6%, 54/346) and abd pain (6.4%, 22/346) accounted for most readmissions. Conclusion: The unplanned readmission rates in IBD pts are high. The most common reasons for readmissions were IBD exacerbations, infections, and abd pain. Future large studies are needed to define national rates of readmissions and risk factors for readmissions in IBD pts. This has the potential to better define risk factors for readmission and improve the quality of care.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M., Al-Jaghbeer</author><author>S., Tekwani</author><author>J., Kahn</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Incidence and etiology of potentially preventable ICU readmissions</title><secondary-title>Critical Care Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Critical Care Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>195-196</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>12 SUPPL. 1</issue><keywords><keyword>*etiology</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*intensive care</keyword><keyword>*society</keyword><keyword>adult</keyword><keyword>cohort analysis</keyword><keyword>diagnostic error</keyword><keyword>hospital</keyword><keyword>hospital patient</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>learning</keyword><keyword>medication error</keyword><keyword>patient</keyword><keyword>university hospital</keyword><keyword>ward</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>M.

The degree to which unplanned readmissions are avoidable is unknown, creating uncertainty about if and how to reduce ICU readmission rates. We sought to determine incidence and underlying causes of potentially avoidable ICU readmissions Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of unplanned ICU readmissions in a large academic medical center during fiscal year 2013. We included adult patients discharged from their first ICU admission with an unplanned readmission within 48 hr of discharge. Each patient's medical chart was reviewed by two independent investigators who rated each readmission's preventability according to standardized scale and assessed the etiology of both preventable and non-preventable readmissions. We then calculated the incidence of preventable readmissions, summarized the causes of readmissions, and compared clinical characteristics between preventable and non-preventable readmissions Results: Of 136 patients in the final analysis, 16 (11.8%, 95% CI: 6.9% - 18.4%) were considered preventable and 120 (88.2%, 95% CI: 81.5% - 93.1%) were considered non-preventable. Of non preventable readmissions, 67 were due to a new clinical problem and 53 were due to an existing clinical problem. Among preventable readmissions, 6 were attributable to system errors, 6 were attributable to management errors, 2 were attributable to procedural events, 1 was attributable to a diagnostic error, and 1 was attributable to medication error. Compared to non-preventable readmissions, potentially avoidable readmissions tended to have shorter ICU lengths of stay (2 days vs. 3 days, p = 0.05) and a shorter duration of time on the ward prior to readmission (16.6 hr vs. 23.6 hr, p = 0.05) Conclusions: A large majority of early ICU readmissions are non-preventable, calling into question the value of the efforts to reduce ICU readmissions and raising important concerns about ICU readmission rates as a hospital performance measure.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Borzecki, Ann M</author><author>Chen, Qi</author><author>Restuccia, Joseph</author><author>Mull, Hillary J</author><author>Shwartz, Michael</author><author>Gupta, Kalpana</author><author>Hanchate, Amresh</author><author>Strymish, Judith</author><author>Rosen, Amy</author><author>A.M., Borzecki</author><author>Q., Chen</author><author>J., Restuccia</author><author>H.J., Mull</author><author>M., Shwartz</author><author>K., Gupta</author><author>A., Hanchate</author><author>J., Strymish</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Do pneumonia readmissions flagged as potentially preventable by the 3M PPR software have more process of care problems?

To improve this measure and identify better quality improvement targets, 3M developed the Potentially Preventable Readmissions (PPRs) measure. It matches clinically related index admission and readmission diagnoses that may indicate readmissions resulting from admission- or post-discharge-related quality problems. Objective To examine whether PPR softwareflagged pneumonia readmissions are associated with poorer quality of care. Methods Using a retrospective observational study design and Veterans Health Administration (VA) data, we identified pneumonia discharges associated with 30-day readmissions, and then flagged cases as PPR-yes or PPR-no using the PPR software. To assess quality of care, we abstracted electronic medical records of 100 random readmissions using a tool containing explicit care processes organised into admission work-up, inhospital evaluation/treatment, discharge readiness and post-discharge period. We derived quality scores, scaled to a maximum of 25 per section (maximum total score=100) and compared cases by total and section-specific mean scores using t tests and effect size (ES) to characterise the clinical significance of findings. Results Our abstraction sample was selected from 11 278 pneumonia readmissions (readmission rate=16.5%) during 1 October 2005-30 September 2010; 77%were flagged as PPR-yes. Contrary to expectations, total and section mean quality scores were slightly higher, although non-significantly, among PPR-yes (N=77) versus PPR-no (N=23) cases (respective total scores, 71.2 +/-8.7 vs 65.8+/-11.5, p=0.14); differences demonstrated ES &gt;0.30 overall and for admission work-up and post-discharge period sections. Conclusions Among VA pneumonia readmissions, PPR categorisation did not produce the expected quality of care findings. Either PPR-yes cases are not more preventable, or preventability assessment requires other data collection methods to capture poorly documented processes (eg, direct observation).</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brudvik, Kristoffer W</author><author>Mise, Yoshihiro</author><author>Conrad, Claudius</author><author>Zimmitti, Giuseppe</author><author>Aloia, Thomas A</author><author>Vauthey, Jean-Nicolas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Definition of readmission in 3,041 patients undergoing hepatectomy</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American College of Surgeons</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American College of Surgeons</full-title></periodical><pages>38-46</pages><volume>221</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*liver resection</keyword><keyword>*statistics and numerical data</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Databases</keyword><keyword>Factual</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hepatectomy</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Logistic Models</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Multivariate Analysis</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Postoperative Complications</keyword><keyword>Postoperative Complications/ep [Epidemiology]</keyword><keyword>ROC Curve</keyword><keyword>Registries</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>abdominal disease/co [Complication]</keyword><keyword>adult</keyword><keyword>aged</keyword><keyword>area under the curve</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>bibliographic database</keyword><keyword>biliary tract surgery</keyword><keyword>diabetes mellitus</keyword><keyword>disease association</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>evaluation study</keyword><keyword>factual database</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>hospital discharge</keyword><keyword>hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>major clinical study</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>middle aged</keyword><keyword>multivariate analysis</keyword><keyword>postoperative complication/co [Complication]</keyword><keyword>priority journal</keyword><keyword>prospective study</keyword><keyword>receiver operating characteristic</keyword><keyword>register</keyword><keyword>retrospective study</keyword><keyword>risk factor</keyword><keyword>statistical model</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>time</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><publisher>Elsevier Inc.</publisher><isbn>1072-7515</isbn><accession-num>26047760</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2015.01.063</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.elsevier.com/locate/jamcollsurg</url><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=emed13&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=2015087698</url><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=emed13&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=26047760</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>STUDY DESIGN: A prospectively maintained database of 3,041 patients who underwent hepatectomy from 1998 through 2013 was merged with the hospital registry to identify readmissions. Area under the curve (AUC) analysis was used to determine the time interval that best captured unplanned readmission., BACKGROUND: Readmission rates of 9.7% to 15.5% after hepatectomy have been reported. These rates are difficult to interpret due to variability in the time interval used to monitor readmission. The aim of this study was to refine the definition of readmission after hepatectomy., RESULTS: Readmission rates at 30 days, 90 days, and 1 year after discharge were 10.7% (n = 326), 17.3% (n = 526), and 31.9% (n = 971) respectively. The time interval that best accounted for unplanned readmissions was 45 days after discharge (AUC, 0.956; p &lt; 0.001), during which 389 patients (12.8%) were readmitted (unplanned: n = 312 [10.3%]; planned: n = 77 [2.5%]). In comparison, the 30 days after surgery interval (used in the ACS-NSQIP database) omitted 65 (26.3%) unplanned readmissions. Multivariate analysis revealed the following risk factors for unplanned readmission: diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 1.6; p = 0.024), right hepatectomy (OR 2.1; p = 0.034), bile duct resection (OR 1.9; p = 0.034), abdominal complication (OR 1.8; p = 0.010), and a major postoperative complication (OR 2.4; p &lt; 0.001). Neither index hospitalization &gt; 7 days nor postoperative hepatobiliary complications were independently associated with readmission., CONCLUSIONS: To accurately assess readmission after hepatectomy, patients should be monitored 45 days after discharge.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Saunders, Neil David</author><author>Nichols, Shawnn D</author><author>Antiporda, Michael Alfredo</author><author>Johnson, Kristen</author><author>Walker, Kerri</author><author>Nilsson, Rhonda</author><author>Graham, Lisa</author><author>Old, Matt</author><author>Klisovic, Rebecca B</author><author>Penza, Sam</author><author>Schmidt, Carl R</author><author>N.D., Saunders</author><author>S.D., Nichols</author><author>M.A., Antiporda</author><author>K., Johnson</author><author>K., Walker</author><author>R., Nilsson</author><author>L., Graham</author><author>M., Old</author><author>R.B., Klisovic</author><author>S., Penza</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Examination of unplanned 30-day readmissions to a comprehensive cancer hospital</title><secondary-title>Journal of oncology practice / American Society of Clinical Oncology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of oncology practice / American Society of Clinical Oncology</full-title></periodical><pages>e177-e181</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>*cancer center</keyword><keyword>*comprehensive cancer hospital</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>80 and over</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Cancer Care Facilities</keyword><keyword>Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (U.S.)</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Inpatients</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>Young Adult</keyword><keyword>adult</keyword><keyword>aged</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>cancer growth</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>major clinical study</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>medicaid</keyword><keyword>medical record</keyword><keyword>medicare</keyword><keyword>postoperative complication/co [Complication]</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>total parenteral nutrition</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>C.R.

Such penalties imply that some readmissions reflect poor clinical decision making or care during the initial hospitalization. We examined factors related to potentially preventable readmissions in CMS patients at a tertiary cancer hospital. METHODS: The medical records of all CMS patients with unplanned readmissions within 30 days of index admission were reviewed over 6 months (October 15, 2011-April 15, 2012). Each readmission was classified as not preventable or potentially preventable. Factors associated with potentially preventable readmissions were sought. RESULTS: Of 2,531 inpatient admissions in CMS patients over 6 months, 185 patients experienced at least one readmission for 282 total readmissions (11%). Median time to readmission was 9 days (range, 0 to 30 days). The most common causes for first readmission were new diagnoses not present at first admission (n = 43, 23%), new or worsening symptoms due to cancer progression (n = 40, 21%) and complications of procedures (n = 25, 13%). There were 38 (21%) initial readmissions classified as potentially preventable. Use of total parenteral nutrition at the time of discharge was associated with potentially preventable readmission (P = .028). CONCLUSION: Most unplanned readmissions to a tertiary cancer hospital are related to progression of disease, new diagnoses, and procedure complications. Minimizing readmissions in complex cancer patients is challenging. Larger multi-institutional datasets are needed to determine a reasonable standard for expected readmission rates.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wallace, Sowdhamini S</author><author>Keller, Stacey L</author><author>Falco, Carla N</author><author>Nead, Jennifer A</author><author>Minard, Charles G</author><author>Nag, Pratip K</author><author>Quinonez, Ricardo A</author><author>S.S., Wallace</author><author>S.L., Keller</author><author>C.N., Falco</author><author>J.A., Nead</author><author>C.G., Minard</author><author>P.K., Nag</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An Examination of Physician-, Caregiver-, and Disease-Related Factors Associated With Readmission From a Pediatric Hospital Medicine Service</title><secondary-title>Hospital pediatrics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hospital pediatrics</full-title></periodical><pages>566-573</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>*caregiver</keyword><keyword>*diagnostic error</keyword><keyword>*medication compliance</keyword><keyword>*pediatrics</keyword><keyword>*statistics and numerical data</keyword><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Aftercare</keyword><keyword>Caregivers</keyword><keyword>Child</keyword><keyword>Cohort Studies</keyword><keyword>Communication</keyword><keyword>Diagnostic Errors</keyword><keyword>Disease Progression</keyword><keyword>Failure to Thrive</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Guideline Adherence</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Infant</keyword><keyword>Lymphadenitis</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Medication Adherence</keyword><keyword>Newborn</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Pediatrics</keyword><keyword>Practice Guidelines as Topic</keyword><keyword>Preschool</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>adolescent</keyword><keyword>aftercare</keyword><keyword>child</keyword><keyword>cohort analysis</keyword><keyword>disease course</keyword><keyword>failure to thrive</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>infant</keyword><keyword>interpersonal communication</keyword><keyword>lymphadenitis</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>newborn</keyword><keyword>practice guideline</keyword><keyword>preschool child</keyword><keyword>retrospective study</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><isbn>2154-1663</isbn><accession-num>26526802</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1542/hpeds.2015-0015</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (An Examination of Physician-, Caregiver-, and Disease-Related Factors Associated With Readmission From a Pediatric Hospital Medicine Service. - Wallace, Sowdhamini S; Keller, Stacey L; Falco, Carla N; Nead, Jennifer A; Minard, Charles G; Nag, Pratip K; Quinonez, Ricardo A)

We also aimed to describe characteristics of potentially preventable cases and the reliability of classification., METHODS: Retrospective descriptive study from December 2008 through June 2010 in a large academic tertiary care children's hospital in Houston, Texas. Children were included if they were readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge from the pediatric hospital medicine service. Reasons for readmission were grouped into three categories: physician-related, caretaker-related, and disease-related. Readmissions with physician- or caretaker-related reasons were considered potentially preventable., RESULTS: The overall readmission rate was 3.1%, and a total of 204 subjects were included in the analysis. Lymphadenitis and failure to thrive had the highest readmission rates with 21%, and 13%, respectively. Twenty percent (n=41/204) of readmissions were preventable with 24% (n=10/41) being physician-related, 12% (n=5/41) caregiver-related, and 63% (n=26/41) for mixed reasons. When comparing classification of readmissions into preventable status, there was moderate agreement between 2 reviewers (K=0.44, 95% confidence interval: 0.28-0.60). Among patients with preventable readmission, the probability of having had a readmission by 7 days and 15 days was 73% and 78%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Reliable identification of preventable pediatric readmissions using individual reviewers remains a challenge. Additional studies are needed to develop a reliable approach to identify preventable readmissions and underlying modifiable factors. A focused review of 7-day readmissions and diagnoses with high readmission rates may allow use of fewer resources.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Blunt, Ian</author><author>Bardsley, Martin</author><author>Grove, Amy</author><author>Clarke, Aileen</author><author>I., Blunt</author><author>M., Bardsley</author><author>A., Grove</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Classifying emergency 30-day readmissions in England using routine hospital data 2004-2010: What is the scope for reduction?</title><secondary-title>Emergency Medicine Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Emergency Medicine Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>44-50</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>*emergency care</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>England</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>International Classification of Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Quality of Health Care</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>United Kingdom</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>artifact</keyword><keyword>chronic disease</keyword><keyword>classification</keyword><keyword>hospital</keyword><keyword>hospital care</keyword><keyword>hospital discharge</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>long term care</keyword><keyword>medical record</keyword><keyword>national health service</keyword><keyword>retrospective study</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>A.

The purpose of this study was to develop an exploratory categorisation based on likely causes of readmission, and then to assess the prevalence of these different types. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 82 million routinely collected National Health Service hospital records in England (2004-2010) was undertaken using anonymised linkage of records at person-level. Numbers of 30-day readmissions were calculated. Exploratory categorisation of readmissions was applied using simple rules relating to International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnostic codes for both admission and readmission. RESULTS: There were 5 804 472 emergency 30-day readmissions over a 6-year period, equivalent to 7.0% of hospital discharges. Readmissions were grouped into hierarchically exclusive categories: potentially preventable readmission (1 739 519 (30.0% of readmissions)); anticipated but unpredictable readmission (patients with chronic disease or likely to need long-term care; 1 141 987 (19.7%)); preference-related readmission (53 718 (0.9%)); artefact of data collection (16 062 (0.3%)); readmission as a result of accident, coincidence or related to a different body system (1 101 818 (19.0%)); broadly related readmission (readmission related to the same body system (1 751 368 (30.2%)). CONCLUSIONS: In this exploratory categorisation, a large minority of emergency readmissions (eg, those that are potentially preventable or due to data artefacts) fell into groups potentially amenable to immediate reduction.

STUDY DESIGN: A total of 1 719 617 hospitalizations for 1 531 828 unique patients in 58 children's hospitals from 2009 to 2011 from the Children's Hospital Association Case-Mix Comparative database were examined. Main outcome measures included rates, diagnoses, and costs of potentially preventable readmissions (PPRs) and all-cause readmissions. RESULTS: The 7-, 15-, and 30-day rates by 3M-PPRs were 2.5%, 4.1%, and 6.2%, respectively. Corresponding all-cause readmission rates were 5.0%, 8.7%, and 13.3%. At 30 days, 60.6% of all-cause readmissions were considered nonpreventable by 3M-PPRs, more than one-half of which were related to malignancies. The percentage of readmissions rated as potentially preventable was similar at all 3 time intervals. Readmissions after chemotherapy, acute leukemia, and cystic fibrosis were all considered nonpreventable, and at least 80% of readmissions after index admissions for sickle cell crisis, bronchiolitis, ventricular shunt procedures, asthma, and appendectomy were designated potentially preventable. Total costs for all readmissions were $1.7 billion; PPRs accounted for 27.3% of these costs. The most costly readmissions were associated with ventricular shunt procedures ($26.5 million/year), seizures ($15.5 million/year), and sickle cell crisis ($15.0 million/year). CONCLUSIONS: Rates of PPRs were significantly lower than all-cause readmission rates more than one-half of which were caused by exclusion of malignancies. Annual costs of PPRs, although significant in the aggregate, appear to represent a much smaller cost-savings opportunity for children than for adults. Our study may help guide children's hospitals to focus readmission reduction strategies on areas where the financial vulnerability is greatest based on 3M-PPRs.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M., Tyson</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Underlying reasons associated with hospital readmission following urologic surgery in the U.S</title><secondary-title>Journal of Urology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Urology</full-title></periodical><pages>e51</pages><volume>195</volume><issue>4 SUPPL. 1</issue><keywords><keyword>*American</keyword><keyword>*United States</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*human</keyword><keyword>*urologic surgery</keyword><keyword>Black person</keyword><keyword>bleeding disorder</keyword><keyword>comorbidity</keyword><keyword>cystectomy</keyword><keyword>disseminated cancer</keyword><keyword>gender</keyword><keyword>hospital</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>logistic regression analysis</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>obstruction</keyword><keyword>patient</keyword><keyword>policy</keyword><keyword>postoperative complication</keyword><keyword>procedures</keyword><keyword>punishment</keyword><keyword>risk</keyword><keyword>sepsis</keyword><keyword>steroid</keyword><keyword>surgical infection</keyword><keyword>underweight</keyword><keyword>urethroplasty</keyword><keyword>urinary tract infection</keyword><keyword>urological procedure</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><pub-location>M.

While hospitals are working to reduce readmissions, more information is needed about the reasons for readmission after urologic surgery. METHODS: Using NSQIP data, we studied patients undergoing urologic surgery during 2013. Readmissions rates and reasons for readmission were assessed for a full-spectrum of urological procedures. Multivariable logistic regression analysis using a forward selection process was performed to identify variables associated with unplanned readmission. The proportion of variation in outcome attributable to one of four categories of variables generally considered to be explanatory for readmission was assessed using McKelvey &amp; Zavoina's R2 for multilevel logistic regression models (complications during index hospitalization, patient comorbidity, patient demographics, and discharge destination). RESULTS: We identified 52,643 urologic surgeries with an unplanned readmission rate of 5.8% (n=3,040). For individual procedures, the readmission rate ranged from 1.4% for urethroplasty to 21.6% for radical cystectomy. The most common reason for unplanned readmission was surgical site infection or urinary tract infections (22%), ileus/bowel obstruction (9%), sepsis (6%), and bleeding/anemia (5%). Increasing age (OR: 1.01 [95% CI: 1.00, 1.01]; P&lt;0.01), male gender (1.23 [1.12, 1.34]; p&lt;0.01), black race (1.26 [1.10, 1.45]; p&lt;0.01), increasing ASA class (1.63 [1.35, 1.97]; p&lt;0.01), underweight BMI (1.24 [1.01, 1.53]; p=0.04), CHF (1.76 [1.20, 2.58]; p&lt;0.01), disseminated cancer (1.52 [1.28, 1.81]; p&lt;0.01), bleeding disorder (1.31 [1.08, 1.60]; p&lt;0.01), steroid use (1.68 [1.41, 2.00]; p&lt;0.01), and index hospital complications (p&lt;0.01 for each) was associated with unplanned readmission after urologic surgery. Discharge to a skilled care facility was protective (0.60 [0.48, 0.75]; p&lt;0.01). Complications during the index hospitalization accounted for most of the variation in risk of unplanned readmission (R2=0.16). CONCLUSIONS: Unplanned readmission after urologic surgery was most closely associated with complications from the index hospitalization as compared to patient comorbidity, demographics, and discharge destination. These data should be considered when developing quality indicators and any policies penalizing hospitals for surgical readmission.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>F., Rubin</author><author>K., Urda</author><author>A., Bilderback</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The hospital elder life program (HELP) can reduce the rate of readmissions</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American Geriatrics Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American Geriatrics Society</full-title></periodical><pages>S125-S126</pages><volume>64</volume><keywords><keyword>*American</keyword><keyword>*geriatrics</keyword><keyword>*hospital</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*society</keyword><keyword>aged</keyword><keyword>chemotherapy</keyword><keyword>community</keyword><keyword>comorbidity</keyword><keyword>cost control</keyword><keyword>delirium</keyword><keyword>diagnosis related group</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>incidence</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>long term care</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>patient</keyword><keyword>teaching hospital</keyword><keyword>weight</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><pub-location>F.

It has been shown to provide substantial financial benefits for the hospital by reducing costs of care and by shortening the length of stay (LOS). However, its effect on 30 day readmissions is unknown. Methods: UPMC Shadyside is a 520 bed community teaching hospital that implemented HELP in 2002. Since HELP is a unit-wide intervention, we compared patients over age 70 on the 8 units where HELP was active (n=2797) with the 10 units without HELP (n=2053) over the 12 months ending June 30, 2014. Readmissions were defined as any unplanned readmission within 30 days of the index admission. We excluded patients who died during the index admission, or who had a planned readmission (e.g., chemotherapy). A mixed-effects Poisson model was constructed with robust standard errors and random- effects to account for patient-level clustering. Models adjusted for age, race, service, comorbidity (DRG weight and Deyo-Charlson score) and LOS. Results: The 30 day readmission rate was 537/2834=19% versus 808/4794=17%, p=.021. In multivariable analyses, the Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) = .90, 95% CI (.79-1.02), p=.091. To reduce bias, we also compared only patients discharged to home, since patients transferred to a long term care facility might be less likely to be readmitted within 30 days. The rate was 381/2416 (14%) in HELP patients vs. 368/1685 (18%) in non-HELP patients, p&lt;.001. HELP patients were less likely to be readmitted, IRR=.82, 95% CI(.70-.97). Thus, patients on a HELP unit were readmitted within 30 days at a rate 18% less than patients on non-HELP units. At our institution, this reduction would result in about 100 readmissions prevented per year, with a cost savings of $220,825. Conclusion: In addition to the known financial benefits to the hospital, HELP also reduces the 30 day readmission rate, which contributes further benefits under the Affordable Care Act. Although we believe that every hospital should have a HELP program to improve care of the elderly, this study provides additional information that supports the cost savings potential of the HELP model.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>P.A., Baltodano</author><author>Y., Webb-Vargas</author><author>K.C., Soares</author><author>C.W., Hicks</author><author>C.M., Cooney</author><author>P., Cornell</author><author>K.K., Burce</author><author>T.M., Pawlik</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A validated, risk assessment tool for predicting readmission after open ventral hernia repair</title><secondary-title>Hernia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hernia</full-title></periodical><pages>119-129</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>*abdominal wall hernia/su [Surgery]</keyword><keyword>*hernioplasty</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*open ventral hernia repair</keyword><keyword>adult</keyword><keyword>anemia</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>bleeding disorder</keyword><keyword>chronic obstructive lung disease</keyword><keyword>clinical assessment tool</keyword><keyword>diabetes mellitus</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>gangrene</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>major clinical study</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>operation duration</keyword><keyword>postoperative period</keyword><keyword>predictive value</keyword><keyword>priority journal</keyword><keyword>receiver operating characteristic</keyword><keyword>risk assessment</keyword><keyword>scoring system</keyword><keyword>underweight</keyword><keyword>validation study</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><pub-location>P.A.

Study design: A total of 17,789 open-VHR patients were identified using the 2011-2012 ACS-NSQIP databases. This cohort was subdivided into 70 and 30 % random testing and validation samples, respectively. Thirty-day unplanned readmission was defined as unexpected readmission for a postoperative occurrence related to the open-VHR procedure. Independent predictors of 30-day unplanned readmission were identified using multivariable logistic regression on the testing sample (n = 12,452 patients). Subsequently, the predictors were weighted according to beta-coefficients to generate an integer-based Clinical Risk Score (CRS) predictive of readmission, which was validated using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis of the validation sample (n = 5337 patients). Results: The rate of 30-day unplanned readmission was 4.7 %. Independent risk factors included inpatient status at time of open-VHR, operation time, enterolysis, underweight, diabetes, preoperative anemia, length of stay, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, history of bleeding disorders, hernia with gangrene, and panniculectomy (all P &lt; 0.05). ROC analysis of the validation cohort rendered an area under the curve of 0.71, which demonstrates the accuracy of this prediction model. Predicted incidence within each 5 risk strata was statistically similar to the observed incidence in the validation sample (P = 0.18), further highlighting the accuracy of this model. Conclusion: We present a validated risk stratification tool for unplanned readmissions following open-VHR. Future studies should determine if implementation of our CRS optimizes safety and reduces readmission rates in open-VHR patients.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sutherland, Kim</author><author>Marashi-Pour, Sadaf</author><author>Chen, Huei-Yang Tom</author><author>Morgan, Ann</author><author>Levesque, Jean-Frederic</author><author>K., Sutherland</author><author>S., Marashi-Pour</author><author>H.-Y., Chen</author><author>A., Morgan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Recast the debate about preventable readmissions</title><secondary-title>BMJ Quality and Safety</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMJ Quality and Safety</full-title></periodical><pages>386-387</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>*clinical indicator</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*risk standardized readmission ratio</keyword><keyword>case mix</keyword><keyword>emergency care</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>intensive care</keyword><keyword>letter</keyword><keyword>medical audit</keyword><keyword>risk assessment</keyword><keyword>total quality management</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><pub-location>K.

Our experience of developing and publicly reporting outcomes in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, suggests that the debate about readmissions should be recast away from ascertaining whether or not a particular hospital readmission was preventable, towards assessing all hospital-level variation in readmission patterns. We agree with the assertion that all-cause readmission rates are less specific and include normally occurring events related to disease progression. They are subject to differences in patient case mix and so are strengthened considerably by the use of clearly defined patient cohorts and appropriate adjustment for patient-level factors. Earlier this year, our organisation published a report using a 30-day risk-standardised readmission ratio (RSRR) indicator for five clinical conditions (acute myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, congestive heart failure, pneumonia and hip fracture surgery) and a 60-day RSRR for two surgical procedures (total hip replacement and total knee replacement). The report drew on linked data from hospital records and death registries covering 12 years (July 2000–June 2012) and highlighted outlier hospitals in the state.2</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rico, Florentino</author><author>Liu, Yazhuo</author><author>Martinez, Diego A</author><author>Huang, Shuai</author><author>Zayas-Castro, Jose L</author><author>Fabri, Peter J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Preventable Readmission Risk Factors for Patients With Chronic Conditions.</title><secondary-title>Journal for healthcare quality : official publication of the National Association for Healthcare Quality</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal for healthcare quality : official publication of the National Association for Healthcare Quality</full-title></periodical><pages>127-142</pages><volume>38</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>26042761</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1097/01.JHQ.0000462674.09641.72</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Evidence indicates that the largest volume of hospital readmissions occurs among  patients with preexisting chronic conditions. Identifying these patients can improve the way hospital care is delivered and prioritize the allocation of interventions. In this retrospective study, we identify factors associated with readmission within 30 days based on claims and administrative data of nine hospitals from 2005 to 2012. We present a data inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify potentially preventable readmissions. Multivariate logistic regression models and a Cox proportional hazards extension are used to estimate the readmission risk for 4 chronic conditions (congestive heart failure [CHF], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], acute myocardial infarction, and type 2 diabetes) and pneumonia, known to be related to high readmission rates. Accumulated number of admissions and discharge disposition were identified to be significant factors across most disease groups. Larger odds of readmission were associated with higher severity index for CHF and COPD patients. Different chronic conditions are associated with different patient and case severity factors, suggesting that further studies in readmission should consider studying conditions separately.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yam, Carrie H K</author><author>Wong, Eliza L Y</author><author>Chan, Frank W K</author><author>Wong, Fiona Y Y</author><author>Leung, Michael C M</author><author>Yeoh, E K</author><author>C.H.K., Yam</author><author>E.L.Y., Wong</author><author>F.W.K., Chan</author><author>F.Y.Y., Wong</author><author>M.C.M., Leung</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Measuring and preventing potentially avoidable hospital readmissions: a review of the literature.</title><secondary-title>Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi / Hong Kong Academy of Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi / Hong Kong Academy of Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>383-389</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Patient Discharge</keyword><keyword>Patient Education as Topic</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>follow up</keyword><keyword>health care system</keyword><keyword>home care</keyword><keyword>hospital admission</keyword><keyword>hospital discharge</keyword><keyword>medical literature</keyword><keyword>medical record review</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>patient counseling</keyword><keyword>patient education</keyword><keyword>review</keyword><keyword>risk factor</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><pub-location>C.

Data sources and Literature search using Medline, PubMed and the Cochrane extraction Library up to June 2010, using the terms &quot;avoidable&quot;, &quot;preventable&quot;, &quot;unplanned&quot;, &quot;unnecessary&quot;, &quot;readmission&quot;, and &quot;rehospitalization&quot;. Study selection A total of 48 original papers and review articles were selected for inclusion in this review. Data synthesis Although hospital readmission seemed to be a term commonly used as an outcome indicator in many studies, it is difficult to make valid comparison of results from different studies. This is because the definitions of terms, methods of data collection, and approaches to data analysis differ greatly. The following criteria for studying hospital readmissions have been recommended: (a) identify hospital admissions and define relevant terms, (b) establish a clinical diagnosis for a readmission; (c) establish the purpose for a readmission, (d) set a discharge-to-readmission timeframe, and (e) identify the sources of information for assessing readmissions. Studies to identify avoidable readmissions usually involve medical records and chart reviews by clinicians using the classification scheme developed by the authors. The proportion of all readmissions assessed as preventable varies from 9 to 59% depending on the population of patients studied, duration of follow-up, type and methodology of the study and case-mix-related factors. A number of studies classified risk factors for readmission into four categories: patient, social, clinical, and ystem factors. Home-based interventions, intensive education/ counselling, multidisciplinary care approaches, and telephone follow-up were the main types of interventions to address potentially avoidable readmissions. Conclusions A standard instrument to identify avoidable readmission is important in enabling valid comparisons within the system and at different timelines, so as to permit robust evaluation of interventions. The assessment of preventable risk factors for readmissions also provides a basis for designing and implementing intervention programmes.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>D., Burke</author><author>N., Link</author><author>D., Bails</author><author>Y., Fang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A taxonomy of seven-day readmissions to an urban teaching hospital</title><secondary-title>Journal of Hospital Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Hospital Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>33-38</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*teaching hospital</keyword><keyword>*urban area</keyword><keyword>adult</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>controlled study</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>hospital admission</keyword><keyword>hospital discharge</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>major clinical study</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>medical record review</keyword><keyword>middle aged</keyword><keyword>priority journal</keyword><keyword>retrospective study</keyword><keyword>substance abuse</keyword><keyword>tertiary care center</keyword><keyword>treatment planning</keyword><keyword>treatment refusal</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><pub-location>M.P.

OBJECTIVE: To identify specific mechanisms of unplanned readmissions through medical narratives obtained from chart reviews. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: Urban tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: Two hundred seventy patients accounted for 335 unplanned 7-day readmissions between July 2010 and July 2011. MEASUREMENTS: Readmissions were classified into 1 of 5 distinct categories. RESULTS: Readmitted subjects were more likely to have had a longer length of stay during the first admission compared to nonreadmitted patients. Readmissions due to unpredictable/unpreventable complications or unrelated events constituted the highest percentage at 46%. Readmissions due to patient factors such as substance abuse, signing out against medical advice, or nonadherence to the treatment plan constituted 31%. Readmissions designated as preventable accounted for 24%. Among preventable readmissions, the most common cause was incomplete management of the index diagnosis. The interobserver level of agreement across the 5 major categories was substantial. CONCLUSIONS: We found through detailed chart review of patients readmitted within 7 days to an urban teaching hospital that the majority of readmissions were not avoidable and were often due to unpredictable or unpreventable complications of the primary diagnosis from the index hospitalization or to patient behaviors that contradicted the treatment plan. These results question the value of readmissions as a valid metric of quality and support future interventions in hospital systems to reduce preventable readmissions.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J.L., Alonso Martinez</author><author>B., Llorente Diez</author><author>M., Echegaray Agara</author><author>M.A., Urbieta Echezarreta</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hospital readmission in internal medicine</title><secondary-title>Anales de medicina interna (Madrid, Spain : 1984)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Anales de medicina interna (Madrid, Spain : 1984)</full-title></periodical><pages>248-254</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>Spain</keyword><keyword>aged</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>internal medicine</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>questionnaire</keyword><keyword>statistics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year></dates><pub-location>J.L.

Readmissions are due to several factors: clinical, hospital related and patient related. We analyze readmission to internal medicine in a hospital of third level. MATERIAL AND METHODS: During 11 months in 1988 we counted all readmissions (R) defined as every previous admission occurred in a span of five years into an area of internal medicine composed by 8 beds. We counted number of readmssions, time from the last readmission, living area (city vs country), sort of primary care physician (GP vs family care specialist), living way (single, with family, institution, homeless). Precipitating factors were observed as well as diseases causing it. R were classified as R related (RR) when readmission was provoked by the same pathological condition or a complication. Multi-readmission (MR), those R caused by the same disease process and treated in different areas and services of the hospital. Avoidable R (AR), those R which did not fullfil AEP criteria. Early readmission (ER) those R occurring before 30 days after last discharge. RESULTS: Three hundred and eleven patients (mean age 67.93 (SD 15.51), males 64%, mean length of stay 7.75 (SD 4.35), 93% admitted from emergency yard, mortality rate 3.5%) were included. R were 111 (35.5%), RR 83 (26 and 75% of RR), MR 68 (82% of RR), ER 33 (39.7% of RR) and AR 16 (19.2% of RR) patients. The most frequent diseases were heart failure and chronic respiratory diseases. Main causes of R were worsening of chronic disease 41 (37%), non-appropriale ambulatory management 24 (22%) erroneous diagnosis 8 (7%), iatrogenic effect 7 (6%), new disease 29 (26%) and others 2 (2%). Mortality rate in R patients was 7.2% (confidence interval 95% 2 to 9%). Number of readmissions were 3.22 (SD 2.25) and time to readmission 8.99 (SD 11.96) months. Living in city (p &lt; 0.05) and to be cared by family physician (p &lt; 0.01) both were factors accelerating readmission. Patients with RR had a higher number of readmissions (3.55 SD 2.23 p &lt; 0.001) and they occurred sooner (8.03 SD 11.85) (p &lt; 0.01). There was a trend to higher readmission rate in female (p 0.052). Fifty-seven percent of RR patients did not have consultation with primary care physician (p &lt; 0.05) (confidence interval 95% 3 to 39%). Consultation with primary care yielded a delay in readmission of 5 months (p &lt; 0.01). Patients with MR had an increased number of readmissions (p &lt; 0.01). Associated factors were iatrogenic effect (p &lt; 0.05), non-appropriate ambulatory management (p &lt; 0.001) and worsening chronic disease (p &lt; 0.001). Patients with ER were readmitted 0.45 (SD 0.30) months after the last discharge and they had a higher mortality rate (p &lt; 0.05). Patients with AR had a mean length of stay shorter (p &lt; 0.05), a trend to higher readmission rate (p = 0.06) and sooner (p = 0.08) with a null mortality rate (p &lt; 0.01). As risk factors for RR in logistic regression were identified MR, AR, ER and causes of readmission consisting in worsening of chronic disease, non-appropriate ambulatory management, erroneous diagnosis and iatrogenic effect. CONCLUSIONS: Our readmission rate is 26%, chronic respiratory diseases and heart failure being the main diseases. Over 39% of causes of readmission could be preventable and there is a facilitation phenomenon in number and time to readmission caused by previous readmissions. Risk factors for readmission in internal medicine are multi-readmission, early and avoidable readmission and as specific causes worsening of chronic disease, non-appropriate ambulatory management, erroneous diagnosis and iatrogenic effect.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S., Brindle</author><author>P., Krecioch</author><author>T., Shin</author><author>M., Hunsinger</author><author>J., Dove</author><author>W., Strodel</author><author>J., Gabrielsen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Predicting preventable causes after bariatric surgery: A look inside the &quot;black box&quot;</title><secondary-title>Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases</full-title></periodical><pages>S103-S104</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>6 SUPPL. 1</issue><keywords><keyword>*American</keyword><keyword>*bariatric surgery</keyword><keyword>*society</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>computer program</keyword><keyword>dehydration</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>emergency ward</keyword><keyword>follow up</keyword><keyword>health care</keyword><keyword>hospital</keyword><keyword>hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>interpersonal communication</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>multivariate analysis</keyword><keyword>nausea</keyword><keyword>obstruction</keyword><keyword>outpatient</keyword><keyword>patient</keyword><keyword>prevalence</keyword><keyword>reoperation</keyword><keyword>risk</keyword><keyword>sleeve gastrectomy</keyword><keyword>statistical significance</keyword><keyword>stomach bypass</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>vomiting</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>S.

Surgical readmissions are associated with poorer overall clinical outcomes as well as significant financial risks for patients as well as providers. Understanding readmissions is challenging because the definition of a readmission varies nationally, regionally and even locally. Different payers have different criteria for defining readmissions. Given this difficulty, understanding what may be preventable readmissions becomes even more difficult. Recent studies suggest that many bariatric readmissions may be preventable. A study from New York State used proprietary software to calculate the prevalence of preventable readmissions; however, due to the complexity of the software, the specific de finition of a preventable readmission was not outlined in the report. The objective of this study was to define readmissions after bariatric surgery and then to determine the incidence of preventable readmissions as well as identify modifiable factors that might assist in decreasing readmission rates. Methods: This is a retrospective review of all readmitted bariatric patients after an initial Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG) from May 1, 2007 through April 30, 2014. Any patient readmitted to the hospital for any length of stay within 30 days of discharge was defined as a readmission. All admissions to outside facilities within 30 days of surgery were included. An emergency room visit was not considered a readmission and no patient remained in the emergency room for more than 23 hours. Readmissions were first classified as unrelated or related to the initial surgery. A readmission was classified as unrelated if the indication (admission diagnosis) was not associated with a surgical diagnosis or a complication and the patient did not receive direct treatment during the initial stay. Patients were also classified as no readmission (NR), preventable readmission (PR) or non-preventable readmission (NPR). A readmission was considered preventable if improvements in a health care process (i.e. discharge, follow up or outpatient management) could have prevented the readmission. Preoperative demographic factors and comorbidities as well as perioperative factors were analyzed using both univariate and multivariate analysis. Patients with preventable readmissions were compared to those with no readmission and also to those with non-preventable readmissions. Results: A total of 2113 patients underwent either RYGB or LSG during the study period. 96% of patients and all readmitted patients were available for 30 days post-operative analysis. There were no significant differences in age, BMI, or sex for any of the three groups. One hundred and thirteen patients (55%) were readmitted during the study period and 25 were for less than 2 midnights (22%). 84% of readmission for less than 2 midnights were considered PR. Of the total readmitted 60 (53%) were NPR and 53 (47%) were PR. Of the PR 49 (92.5%, p=0.058) were related to the initial surgery. Patients with a readmission indication of nausea, vomiting or dehydration (NVD) were the most likely to have a PR (62.3% v 33.3%, p=0.002). [Table #1] NPR were more likely for those admitted with a major complications (53.3% v 15.1%, p &lt;0.0001), including obstructions and leaks as well as those requiring reoperation (38.3% v 13.2%, p=0.003). Compared to NPR, the time to readmission was one shorter for the PR (6 vs. 7 days respectively, p value 0.5620) and LOS was significantly longer for NPR (4.5 vs. 2 days). Multivariate analysis showed that GERD (p=0.017) and readmission related to initial surgery (p=0.031) were significantly associated with PR. Conclusions: The rate of potentially preventable readmissions in a large, single institution cohort with excellent patient follow up was 47%. Like others, our study showed that nausea, vomiting or dehydration was the most frequent cause of readmission. Patients with NVD were also the most likely to have a PR. As expected, those patients readmitte with a major complication or for reoperation were significantly associated with NPR. Our plan is to further investigate the social and communication factors involved in patients with preventable readmissions to identify interventions that may prevent the need for readmission.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>B., Cakir</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluating readmission rates: How can we improve?</title><secondary-title>Southern Medical Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Southern Medical Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>1079-1083</pages><volume>103</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>Caucasian</keyword><keyword>acute kidney failure</keyword><keyword>adult</keyword><keyword>anemia</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>cerebrovascular accident</keyword><keyword>chronic obstructive lung disease</keyword><keyword>comorbidity</keyword><keyword>congestive heart failure</keyword><keyword>coronary artery disease</keyword><keyword>diabetes mellitus</keyword><keyword>diabetic ketoacidosis</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>follow up</keyword><keyword>gastrointestinal hemorrhage</keyword><keyword>heart arrhythmia</keyword><keyword>hospital admission</keyword><keyword>hospital discharge</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>hypertension</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>major clinical study</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>medical record review</keyword><keyword>mortality</keyword><keyword>nausea and vomiting</keyword><keyword>patient education</keyword><keyword>peripheral vascular disease</keyword><keyword>pneumonia</keyword><keyword>retrospective study</keyword><keyword>sepsis</keyword><keyword>transient ischemic attack</keyword><keyword>urinary tract infection</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><pub-location>B.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective medical chart review on patients who were rehospitalized with the same diagnosis within 30 days over a period of one year. Results: Among 5,206 patients who were admitted to the hospitalist service over one year, 85 (1.6%) were rehospitalized within 30 days due to the same condition. Of the 85 readmitted patients, 47% were male and 82% were Caucasian, with a mean age of 58 +/- 17 years. The top diagnoses were pneumonia, sepsis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Follow-up appointments were made for only 27% of patients at first admission. Ninety percent of patients received an accurate medication list at discharge. Mortality within three months was higher in patients with sepsis, more comorbidities, longer length of stay at first hospitalization, and those discharged to a nursing home after readmission. Only 4.7% of readmissions were concluded to be preventable. Conclusion: Our readmission rate (1.6%) is significantly lower than that of previous studies (23.2%), as we included the readmissions only due to the same diagnosis. Patient education, family involvement in discharge process, and scheduling follow-up appointments could potentially reduce readmissions, despite multiple unmodifiable factors. We suspect all-cause readmissions have room for more improvement, which should be the focus of intervention.

This paper reviews readmission policies in Denmark, England, Germany and the United States (Medicare system). The suggested roadmap enables researchers and policy makers to systematically compare and analyse readmission policies. We find considerable differences across countries. In Germany, the readmission policy aims to avoid unintended consequences of the introduction of DRG-based payment; it focuses on readmissions of individual patients and hospitals receive only one DRG-based payment for both the initial and the re-admission. In Denmark, England and the US readmission policies aim at quality improvement and focus on readmission rates. In Denmark, readmission rates are publicly reported but payments are not adjusted in relation to readmissions. In England and the US, financial incentives penalise hospitals with readmission rates above a certain benchmark. In England, this benchmark is defined through local clinical review, while it is based on the risk-adjusted national average in the US. At present, not enough evidence exists to give recommendations on the optimal design of readmission policies. The roadmap can be a tool for systematically assessing how elements of other countries' readmission policies can potentially be adopted to improve national policies.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>V., Shatkar</author><author>V., Hariharan</author><author>M., Alade</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Financial penalties for surgical readmission-the true cost of bad data?</title><secondary-title>Colorectal Disease</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Colorectal Disease</full-title></periodical><pages>57</pages><volume>15</volume><keywords><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*human</keyword><keyword>*punishment</keyword><keyword>*society</keyword><keyword>United Kingdom</keyword><keyword>abdominal pain</keyword><keyword>adult</keyword><keyword>cholelithiasis</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>general hospital</keyword><keyword>health care system</keyword><keyword>hospital</keyword><keyword>hospital care</keyword><keyword>pain</keyword><keyword>pathology</keyword><keyword>patient</keyword><keyword>procedures</keyword><keyword>retrospective study</keyword><keyword>wound</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><pub-location>V.

In 2009/10 there were 276 386 adult hospital readmissions in England. Readmissions increase cost to the healthcare system and are preventable. Method: A retrospective study of all surgical readmissions over a period of 12 weeks to two District General Hospitals in the UK was done. Results: One hundred and ninety-seven case records were reviewed. The majority of readmissions were related to the index pathology (74.5%). Post-op wound collection (10.6%), cholelithiasis (10.1%), nonspecific abdominal pain (7.6%), and post-operative pain (6.6%) were the main causes for readmissions. Sixty percent of patients were women. 80.9% of all patients readmitted with wound collections required drainage procedures. Non-surgical pathologies were coded as surgical admissions (10.8%). The overall cost of readmissions was 395 495, with a projected annual cost of 1.7 million. Twenty-seven (13.7%) readmissions reviewed were not releveant with index procedure and therefore avoidable (projected annual saving 182 593). Coding errors were responsible for 11.2% of all readmissions which were incorrectly classed under the surgical directorate. Conclusion: The bulk of surgical readmissions are a consequence of operative activity and/or chronic pathology. Combining all avoidable cases and those incorrectly coded, 462 634 could be saved.</abstract></record><record><database name="Aidan Citations.enl" path="Aidan Citations.enl">Aidan Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>G.D., Sacks</author><author>A.J., Dawes</author><author>M.M., Russell</author><author>A.Y., Lin</author><author>M.M., Gibbons</author><author>A., Tillou</author><author>J.S.T., Linson</author><author>D.T., Hiyama</author><author>J.R., Hiatt</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>All-cause surgical readmissions: Does administrative data tell the real story?</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American College of Surgeons</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American College of Surgeons</full-title></periodical><pages>S97-S97</pages><volume>215</volume><issue>3 SUPPL. 1</issue><keywords><keyword>*college</keyword><keyword>*human</keyword><keyword>*surgeon</keyword><keyword>aorta valve replacement</keyword><keyword>clinical study</keyword><keyword>colon resection</keyword><keyword>convenience sample</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>documentation</keyword><keyword>general surgery</keyword><keyword>hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>lobectomy</keyword><keyword>medical record</keyword><keyword>medical record review</keyword><keyword>patient</keyword><keyword>physician</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><pub-location>G.D.

Our study aim was two-Fold: (1) to apply the proposed readmission measure to a selected cohort of surgical readmissions; (2) to determine accuracy of administrative codes at determining cause for readmission. METHODS: Patients discharged from general surgery services over eight consecutive quarters (Q4 2009-Q3 2011) were selected. 30-day readmissions were identified and physician review of the medical record was performed. Readmission reason was determined using clinical data. Planned readmissions based on the CMS measure were identified. RESULTS: Analysis of a convenience sample of 128 surgical readmissions identified only 4 planned readmissions (3%) for scheduled surgery (2 colon resections, 1 thoracic lobectomy, 1 aortic valve replacement), and thus 97% were considered unplanned by the CMS measure. Of the remaining 124 readmissions, 18% were excluded based on reason for readmission as determined from the clinical data (Table). Comparing administrative data to clinical medical record documentation, one third of readmissions were coded incorrectly. Reasons for coding discrepancy were: coding of a secondary diagnosis code (40%), coding a chronic rather than acute medical condition (30%), and inaccurate code (30%). (Table presented) CONCLUSIONS: Using the CMS readmission measure identifies 97% of surgical readmissions as unplanned. In contrast, medical record review identifies only 57% of readmissions with an acute problem related to the index admission. Given the large discrepancy between administrative and clinical data in determining unplanned readmissions, further work is needed to better classify surgical readmissions before endorsing an all-cause readmission measure.</abstract></record></records></xml>
