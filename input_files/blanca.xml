DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of a stratified random sample of case notes of patients with an unplanned readmission between July 1987 and June 1988 by nine clinical assessors (263 assessments) and categorisation of the readmission as avoidable, unavoidable, or unclassifiable. SETTING: District in North East Thames region. 481 General medical, geriatric, and general surgical inpatients with a readmission at 0-6 days or 21-27 days after the first (index) discharge between July 1987 and June 1988 from whom 100 case notes were selected randomly and of which 74 were available for study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Assessment of readmissions as avoidable, unavoidable, unclassifiable, variability of assessment within cases and variability among assessors according to specialty and duration to readmission. RESULTS: General medical and geriatric readmissions and surgical readmissions at 0-6 days after discharge were more likely to be assessed as avoidable than those at 21-27 days (medical readmissions 32 v 6%, surgical admissions 49 v 19%). General surgical readmissions were significantly more frequently assessed as avoidable than general medical and geriatric readmissions. The extent of agreement between doctors varied, with general medical and geriatric readmissions at 21-27 days after first discharge causing the greatest variability of judgment. CONCLUSIONS: Differences were apparent in the extent of avoidability of readmissions in different groups of admissions. However, assessors rated only 49.3% of the group with the highest proportion of avoidable admissions (surgical readmissions at 0-6 days) as avoidable. The remainder were thought to be unavoidable except for 2%, which could not be classified. The use of readmission rates as an outcome indicator of hospital inpatient care should be avoided.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Frankl, S E</author><author>Breeling, J L</author><author>Goldman, L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Preventability of emergent hospital readmission.</title><secondary-title>The American journal of medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The American journal of medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>667-674</pages><volume>90</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Boston</keyword><keyword>Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Follow-Up Studies</keyword><keyword>Hospital Bed Capacity, 500 and over</keyword><keyword>Hospitals, Teaching</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Patient Compliance</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Postoperative Complications</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>Utilization Review</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>utilization</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1991</year></dates><accession-num>2042681</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>To determine whether emergent readmissions within 30 days of discharge are potentially preventable, we prospectively studied all readmissions to the medical service of a university teaching hospital during a 4-month period. The 327 readmissions, including 42 patients who were readmitted more than once during the study period, accounted for 12% of medical admissions. Nearly 75% of readmissions were due to previously diagnosed medical conditions; complications of drugs or therapeutic procedures caused 29%, and patient compliance contributed to 11%. Three reviewers judged 28 (9%) readmissions to be potentially preventable. These 28 readmissions constituted 1% of all admissions to the medical service and did not result in any fatalities, indicating that the quality of care was generally very good. One third of the potentially preventable readmissions were thought to be related to medical system failures, one third to an unfulfilled hope that the patient would improve after discharge, and one third to other suboptimal judgements in evaluation or treatment. Of the 28 potentially preventable readmissions, 89% occurred within 10 days of discharge. We conclude that potentially preventable readmissions would nearly always be detected by review of readmissions within 10 days of discharge and that many may be amenable to systematic interventions such as standardized predischarge assessment and better coordination of post-discharge follow-up.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kelly, J F</author><author>McDowell, H</author><author>Crawford, V</author><author>Stout, R W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Readmissions to a geriatric medical unit: is prevention possible?</title><secondary-title>Aging (Milan, Italy)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Aging (Milan, Italy)</full-title></periodical><pages>61-67</pages><volume>4</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Aged, 80 and over</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Health Services for the Aged</keyword><keyword>Hospital Units</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Northern Ireland</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Utilization Review</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>utilization</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1992</year></dates><accession-num>1627678</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Of the 622 patients admitted to a geriatric medical unit during the period November 1985 to October 1986, 211 (33.9%) had been discharged from hospital within the previous year. Of these, 117 (55.5%) had previously been admitted to the geriatric medical unit (18.8% of all admissions). The reasons for readmission were deterioration of existing disease (47.4%), new medical events (33.2%), poor management of previous discharge (9.5%), and social problems (5.7%). Age was not a significant factor influencing readmission. Readmission was judged preventable by better management of the previous admission and discharge in only 33 cases (15.6% of readmissions). A prospective study of the patients discharged in the same year revealed that 19.3% were readmitted in the following year, and of these readmissions 2.3% were considered to be preventable. There was no difference in medical causes for readmission in the two years. A significant number of the patients readmitted in both years studied was categorized as &quot;high dependency&quot;. The figures suggest that although unplanned readmission is common, it is generally not preventable by better management of the previous admission, and often reflects a highly dependent and medically frail group of patients, in whom early intervention with readmission is appropriate.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Henderson, J</author><author>Graveney, M J</author><author>Goldacre, M J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Should emergency readmissions be used as health service indicators and in medical audit?</title><secondary-title>Health services management research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Health services management research</full-title></periodical><pages>109-116</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Appendectomy</keyword><keyword>Data Collection</keyword><keyword>Emergency Service, Hospital</keyword><keyword>Great Britain</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Medical Audit</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Prostatectomy</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>utilization</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1993</year></dates><accession-num>10126674</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>This study examined the temporal relationships between index discharges from hospital and emergency readmissions in the area covered by the Oxford record linkage study in the years 1975-84.

The time intervals between elective prostatectomy or emergency appendicectomy and emergency readmissions were also examined as examples of specific operations. Readmissions clustered strikingly in the first few weeks following discharge. Over a third of emergency readmissions in the year following discharge occurred in the first four weeks. This close temporal proximity indicates that emergency readmissions are generally associated with the first index admission and therefore that emergency readmissions are appropriate topics for further investigation through health services research and medical audit.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gautam, P</author><author>Macduff, C</author><author>Brown, I</author><author>Squair, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Unplanned readmissions of elderly patients</title><secondary-title>Health bulletin</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Health bulletin</full-title></periodical><pages>449-457</pages><volume>54</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>80 and over</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Cohort Studies</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Iatrogenic Disease</keyword><keyword>Length of Stay</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Patient Discharge</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Recurrence</keyword><keyword>Scotland</keyword><keyword>Socioeconomic Factors</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1996</year></dates><pub-location>P.

DESIGN: Patients living within Aberdeen who were discharged from Care of the Elderly Assessment Wards in one hospital between 1 August 1994 and 31 January 1995 were identified. Any subsequent unplanned readmissions of this population to any local hospital within 28 days were identified and formed the study's sample. Subsequent comparison with the non-readmitted population yielded readmission rates. The nature of each episode was investigated by obtaining a wide range of data (e.g. from medical and nursing notes) soon after readmission and by the audit team subsequently identifying principal and associated causative factors. A questionnaire was also sent to the discharging consultant and the patient's GP seeking opinions on whether readmission was avoidable and these were weighted equally with the audit team's opinion in order to establish avoidability. SETTING: The patients were all discharged from the nine Care of the Elderly Assessment wards at Woodend Hospital in Aberdeen and readmitted to any NHS hospital within Aberdeen. SUBJECTS: The subjects were patients living within Aberdeen who satisfied the above criteria. RESULTS: There were 109 episodes of readmission resulting from 713 discharges, making a readmission rate of 15.3%. The readmitted population was elderly with multiple medical problems; 50% lived alone. In 87% of cases the principal causative factor in readmission was medical, most commonly involving relapse of illness. The remaining 13% were 'social' in nature. Response rates to the questionnaire by GP's and Consultants were excellent (96% and 99% respectively) and 34 cases emerged where either party, or both, thought readmission to be avoidable. These cases were subject to further review by the audit team and in this way 16 of the 34 cases were judged to be avoidable. The main area for improvement was considered to be pre-discharge assessment of home circumstances. CONCLUSION: The majority of unplanned readmissions were medical in nature and unavoidable. The use of rates of unplanned readmission as a measure of clinical outcome in care of the elderly is unsatisfactory as they do not accurately reflect the quality of in-patient care.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Oddone, E Z</author><author>Weinberger, M</author><author>Horner, M</author><author>Mengel, C</author><author>Goldstein, F</author><author>Ginier, P</author><author>Smith, D</author><author>Huey, J</author><author>Farber, N J</author><author>Asch, D A</author><author>Loo, L</author><author>Mack, E</author><author>Hurder, A G</author><author>Henderson, W</author><author>Feussner, J R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Classifying general medicine readmissions.

DESIGN: The instrument was developed in two phases. Phase 1 was a prospective comparison of admitting residents' and their attending physicians' classifications of the perceived preventability of consecutive admissions to one Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) excluding admissions to the intensive care unit (ICU). In phase 2, a panel of 10 physicians rated 811 abstracted records of readmissions from nine VAMCs. SETTING: Nine VAMCs across the United States with varying degrees of university hospital affiliation. PATIENTS: Phase 1, 156 patients admitted to the general medicine service at the Durham VAMC. Phase 2, 514 patients accounting for 811 readmissions within 6 months of a general medicine service discharge at nine VAMCs. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Physicians used a checklist to record the reason for hospitalization, the preventability of the hospitalization, and, if preventable, a reason defining preventability, which was classified in terms of system, clinician, and patient factors. In phase 2, two physician panelists assessed preventability for each chart. When two panelists disagreed on the preventability of hospitalization, a third panelist, blind to the original assessments, rated the chart. In phase 1, residents and attending physicians rated 33% and 34% of admissions as preventable (kappa = 0.41), respectively. In phase 2, 277 (34%) of 811 readmissions were deemed preventable. Intraobserver accuracy for the assessment of preventability was 96% (kappa = 0.89). interobserver accuracy was 73% (kappa = 0.43). Hospital system factors accounted for 37% of preventable readmissions, clinician factors for 38%, and patient factors for 21%. The nine hospitals differed markedly in their profile of reasons for preventable readmissions (p = .005). CONCLUSIONS: Using a new method of determining the preventability of hospitalizations, we identified several factors that might avert hospitalizations. Focusing efforts to identify preventable hospitalizations may yield better methods for managing patients' total health care needs; however, the content of those efforts will vary by institution.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Miles, T A</author><author>Lowe, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Are unplanned readmissions to hospital really preventable?</title><secondary-title>Journal of Quality in Clinical Practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Quality in Clinical Practice</full-title></periodical><pages>211-214 4p</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>500 and over</keyword><keyword>80 and Over</keyword><keyword>80 and over</keyword><keyword>Adolescence</keyword><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Appointments and Schedules</keyword><keyword>Bed Occupancy</keyword><keyword>Child</keyword><keyword>Clinical Indicators</keyword><keyword>Cost Benefit Analysis</keyword><keyword>Data Collection</keyword><keyword>Health Care</keyword><keyword>Hospital Bed Capacity</keyword><keyword>Human</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Infant</keyword><keyword>Middle Age</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>New South Wales</keyword><keyword>Newborn</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Preschool</keyword><keyword>Quality Indicators</keyword><keyword>Quality of Health Care</keyword><keyword>Readmission</keyword><keyword>Scales</keyword><keyword>Severity of Illness</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year></dates><pub-location>Executive Office, John Hunter Hospital, Locked Bag No. 1, Hunter Region Mail Centre, Newcastle, NSW 2310, Australia</pub-location><publisher>Wiley-Blackwell</publisher><accession-num>10619148</accession-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (Are unplanned readmissions to hospital really preventable? - TA, Miles; Lowe, J)

Twenty-four readmissions out of 3081 total admissions (0.8%) were defined as adverse events (unplanned readmissions) being nominally due to inappropriate medical management. The 24 adverse events comprised 5.5% of the 437 readmissions. A further five readmissions occurred because scheduled theatre was cancelled. Remaining readmissions were due to the condition of the patient in each case. Of the 16 highly preventable adverse events, 10 were allocated to the minor temporary category of severity. It is difficult to evaluate these readmission rates because there are no comparable findings in other Australian studies. The adverse events showed no particular association with patient age, sex, hospital of original admission or hospital specialty. While they were technically preventable, after medical record review a senior clinician identified these as extremely difficult cases, indicating that better outcomes may not have been possible.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kwok, T</author><author>Lau, E</author><author>Woo, J</author><author>Luk, J K</author><author>Wong, E</author><author>Sham, A</author><author>Lee, S H</author><author>T., Kwok</author><author>E., Lau</author><author>J., Woo</author><author>J.K., Luk</author><author>E., Wong</author><author>A., Sham</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hospital readmission among older medical patients in Hong Kong</title><secondary-title>Journal of the Royal College of Physicians of London</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the Royal College of Physicians of London</full-title></periodical><pages>153-156</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>*elderly care</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Cohort Studies</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Follow-Up Studies</keyword><keyword>Health Services for the Aged</keyword><keyword>Hong Kong</keyword><keyword>Hong Kong/ep [Epidemiology]</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Length of Stay</keyword><keyword>Logistic Models</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>aged</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>cohort analysis</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>follow up</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>risk factor</keyword><keyword>statistical model</keyword><keyword>statistics</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>time</keyword><keyword>utilization</keyword><keyword>utilization review</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year></dates><pub-location>T.

DESIGN: Cohort study. SUBJECTS: 1,204 consecutive hospital medical patients aged 70 years and over in Hong Kong. PROCEDURES: Subjects were interviewed by a research nurse on discharge, and were followed up for six months. OUTCOME: Unplanned hospital readmissions were identified and classified as avoidable or unavoidable. The risk factors for early (within 28 days), recurrent (three or more) and avoidable readmissions were studied by multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Four hundred and fifty-five patients (37.7%) had at least one readmission in six months; 18%, 6.4%, and 2.9% of subjects had early, recurrent and avoidable readmissions respectively. Recent hospital stay predicted all types of readmissions. Early readmission was predicted by length of stay, Barthel index (assessment of physical and mental function) and unresolved medical problems. Recurrence readmission was predicted by poor family support, residence in a home for the elderly and unresolved medical problems. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital readmission may be prevented by ensuring adequate length of stay, so that medical problems are resolved before discharge.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kossovsky, M P</author><author>Sarasin, F P</author><author>Perneger, T V</author><author>Chopard, P</author><author>Sigaud, P</author><author>Gaspoz, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Unplanned readmissions of patients with congestive heart failure: do they reflect in-hospital quality of care or patient characteristics?</title><secondary-title>The American journal of medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The American journal of medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>386-390</pages><volume>109</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Aged, 80 and over</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Demography</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Hospitals, Teaching</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Medical Records</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Predictive Value of Tests</keyword><keyword>Quality of Health Care</keyword><keyword>Severity of Illness Index</keyword><keyword>Switzerland</keyword><keyword>physiopathology</keyword><keyword>standards</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>therapy</keyword><keyword>utilization</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year></dates><accession-num>11020395</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>PURPOSE: To determine if early unplanned readmissions of patients hospitalized for heart failure are associated with suboptimal in-hospital care or with the clinical and demographic characteristics of the patient. SUBJECT AND METHODS: We performed a case-control study among patients discharged with a principal diagnosis of heart failure. Cases included all patients unexpectedly readmitted within 31 days of discharge; controls were randomly selected from among those not readmitted. Quality of care was measured using explicit criteria reflecting the admission work-up, evaluation and treatment, and readiness for discharge. RESULTS: Ninety-one cases and 351 controls were included. There was no significant association between early unplanned readmissions and the scores for quality of the admission work-up or evaluation and treatment during the stay. There was a significant association between readiness for discharge and subsequent early readmission: for each 10% decrease in the proportion of fulfilled criteria, the odds of readmission increased by 14% (95% confidence interval [CI] 1. 01 to 1.28, P = 0.04) for all-cause readmissions and by 19% (95% CI: 1.04 to 1.36, P = 0.01) for heart-failure-related readmissions. In a multiple logistic regression model, previous diagnosis of heart failure (odds ratio [OR] = 2.9, 95% CI: 1.7 to 4.8, P &lt;0.001), age (OR = 3.3, 95% CI: 1.3 to 8.5, P = 0.01 for patients aged 65 to 79 years and OR = 4.1, 95% CI: 1.6 to 11, P = 0.004 for patients aged 80 years and older), and history of cardiac revascularization (OR = 2.1, 95% CI: 1.2 to 3.9, P = 0.01) showed a stronger association with early unplanned all-cause readmissions than the readiness-for-discharge score (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.31, P = 0.02). Similar findings were seen for heart failure-related readmissions. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with heart failure, early unplanned readmissions were not associated with suboptimal admission work-up or evaluation and treatment but were weakly associated with readiness for discharge. However, they were strongly associated with the patients' clinical and demographic characteristics.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>A, Levy</author><author>K, Alsop</author><author>M, Hehir</author><author>V, Lock</author><author>R, Greenwood</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hospital readmissions.

Readmissions are due to several factors: clinical, hospital related and patient related. We analyze readmission to internal medicine in a hospital of third level. MATERIAL AND METHODS: During 11 months in 1988 we counted all readmissions (R) defined as every previous admission occurred in a span of five years into an area of internal medicine composed by 8 beds. We counted number of readmssions, time from the last readmission, living area (city vs country), sort of primary care physician (GP vs family care specialist), living way (single, with family, institution, homeless). Precipitating factors were observed as well as diseases causing it. R were classified as R related (RR) when readmission was provoked by the same pathological condition or a complication. Multi-readmission (MR), those R caused by the same disease process and treated in different areas and services of the hospital. Avoidable R (AR), those R which did not fullfil AEP criteria. Early readmission (ER) those R occurring before 30 days after last discharge. RESULTS: Three hundred and eleven patients (mean age 67.93 (SD 15.51), males 64%, mean length of stay 7.75 (SD 4.35), 93% admitted from emergency yard, mortality rate 3.5%) were included. R were 111 (35.5%), RR 83 (26 and 75% of RR), MR 68 (82% of RR), ER 33 (39.7% of RR) and AR 16 (19.2% of RR) patients. The most frequent diseases were heart failure and chronic respiratory diseases. Main causes of R were worsening of chronic disease 41 (37%), non-appropriale ambulatory management 24 (22%) erroneous diagnosis 8 (7%), iatrogenic effect 7 (6%), new disease 29 (26%) and others 2 (2%). Mortality rate in R patients was 7.2% (confidence interval 95% 2 to 9%). Number of readmissions were 3.22 (SD 2.25) and time to readmission 8.99 (SD 11.96) months. Living in city (p &lt; 0.05) and to be cared by family physician (p &lt; 0.01) both were factors accelerating readmission. Patients with RR had a higher number of readmissions (3.55 SD 2.23 p &lt; 0.001) and they occurred sooner (8.03 SD 11.85) (p &lt; 0.01). There was a trend to higher readmission rate in female (p 0.052). Fifty-seven percent of RR patients did not have consultation with primary care physician (p &lt; 0.05) (confidence interval 95% 3 to 39%). Consultation with primary care yielded a delay in readmission of 5 months (p &lt; 0.01). Patients with MR had an increased number of readmissions (p &lt; 0.01). Associated factors were iatrogenic effect (p &lt; 0.05), non-appropriate ambulatory management (p &lt; 0.001) and worsening chronic disease (p &lt; 0.001). Patients with ER were readmitted 0.45 (SD 0.30) months after the last discharge and they had a higher mortality rate (p &lt; 0.05). Patients with AR had a mean length of stay shorter (p &lt; 0.05), a trend to higher readmission rate (p = 0.06) and sooner (p = 0.08) with a null mortality rate (p &lt; 0.01). As risk factors for RR in logistic regression were identified MR, AR, ER and causes of readmission consisting in worsening of chronic disease, non-appropriate ambulatory management, erroneous diagnosis and iatrogenic effect. CONCLUSIONS: Our readmission rate is 26%, chronic respiratory diseases and heart failure being the main diseases. Over 39% of causes of readmission could be preventable and there is a facilitation phenomenon in number and time to readmission caused by previous readmissions. Risk factors for readmission in internal medicine are multi-readmission, early and avoidable readmission and as specific causes worsening of chronic disease, non-appropriate ambulatory management, erroneous diagnosis and iatrogenic effect.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Halfon, Patricia</author><author>Eggli, Yves</author><author>van Melle, Guy</author><author>Chevalier, Julia</author><author>Wasserfallen, Jean Blaise</author><author>Burnand, Bernard</author><author>P., Halfon</author><author>Y., Eggli</author><author>G., Van Melle</author><author>J., Chevalier</author><author>J.-B., Wasserfallen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Measuring potentially avoidable hospital readmissions</title><secondary-title>Journal of Clinical Epidemiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Clinical Epidemiology</full-title></periodical><pages>573-587</pages><volume>55</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>80 and over</keyword><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Algorithms</keyword><keyword>Analysis of Variance</keyword><keyword>Child</keyword><keyword>Computerized</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis-Related Groups</keyword><keyword>Health Services Misuse</keyword><keyword>Hospitals</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Infant</keyword><keyword>Medical Records Systems</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care)</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Preschool</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Sensitivity and Specificity</keyword><keyword>Switzerland</keyword><keyword>University</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>standards</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>utilization</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year></dates><pub-location>P.

We studied hospital information system data of a random sample of 3,474 inpatients discharged alive in 1997 from a university hospital and medical records of those (1,115) readmitted within 1 year. The gold standard was set on the basis of the hospital data and medical records: all readmissions were classified as foreseen readmissions, unforeseen readmissions for a new affection, or unforeseen readmissions for a previously known affection. The latter category was submitted to a systematic medical record review to identify the main cause of readmission. Potentially avoidable readmissions were defined as a subgroup of unforeseen readmissions for a previously known affection occurring within an appropriate interval, set to maximize the chance of detecting avoidable readmissions. The computerized screening algorithm was strictly based on routine statistics: diagnosis and procedures coding and admission mode. The prediction was based on a Poisson regression model. There were 454 (13.1%) unforeseen readmissions for a previously known affection within 1 year. Fifty-nine readmissions (1.7%) were judged avoidable, most of them occurring within 1 month, which was the interval used to define potentially avoidable readmissions (n = 174, 5.0%). The intra-sample sensitivity and specificity of the screening algorithm both reached approximately 96%. Higher risk for potentially avoidable readmission was associated with previous hospitalizations, high comorbidity index, and long length of stay; lower risk was associated with surgery and delivery. The model offers satisfactory predictive performance and a good medical plausibility. The proposed measure could be used as an indicator of inpatient care outcome. However, the instrument should be validated using other sets of data from various hospitals. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

DESIGN: A conceptual model was developed based on the risk curve. The model assigned readmissions above a background level as 'related' to the earlier episode of illness. The characteristics of the hazard curve were used to estimate how the rates of related and unrelated readmissions varied with time. SETTING: Patients living in a region of Middle Norway served by eight acute-care hospitals and discharged in the year 1996. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The conditional risk (hazard rate) of having an unplanned readmission. The information gathered allowed inclusion of readmissions to all hospitals in the area, and to make risk corrections for deaths. RESULTS: The identified proportion of readmissions judged as related to the earlier episode of illness was found to be very sensitive to changes in the time interval. With the commonly used interval of 30 days, 0.5 of all related readmissions were identified, while 0.7 of the readmissions included at this time were estimated as related ones ('true positives'). The hazard curve was different for medical and surgical patients, but the corresponding proportions of related and unrelated readmissions were relatively similar. Adjusting for deaths in the observation period did not result in significantly different risk curves. CONCLUSION: When unplanned readmissions are used as an outcome indicator, the measure is susceptible to the choice of time interval. The operative characteristics must be interpreted in the context of where it is intended that the indicator should be used.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dobrzanska, L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Readmissions -- an evaluation of reasons for unplanned readmissions of older people: a United Kingdom and international studies literature review.</title><secondary-title>Quality in Ageing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Quality in Ageing</full-title></periodical><pages>20-28 9p</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Disease</keyword><keyword>Outcomes (Health Care)</keyword><keyword>Readmission -- In Old Age</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><pub-location>Nurse Case Manager, North Bradford Primary Care Trust</pub-location><publisher>Emerald Group Publishing Limited</publisher><notes>Accession Number: 106491289.

There is a wide variation between readmission rates, and it is especially important to older people that there is a reduction in unacceptable variations. A closer understanding of reasons for readmission is therefore necessary to inform future developments, identify patients who may be at high risk of readmission and target resources more appropriately. A review of literature from the United Kingdom and international studies may help in determining the reasons for the unplanned readmission of older people. This could then allow for a re-allocation of resources in the most cost-effective and cost-efficient manner. The literature review was conducted via keywords and combination of keyword searches from 1990-2003 using various electronic databases. There were several themes that emerged from the literature, and these have been described within the paper. Following the review of the literature it emerged that many international studies into the causes of readmission of older people have an inconsistent approach in defining certain terms. However, in the United Kingdom, there appears a more consistent approach. Most studies agree that the majority of readmissions occur as a result of a relapse or complication of an initial illness. However, some American studies associate the readmission of older people with a specific disease, and the antecedent care process. The findings in the literature have identified several gaps that enable recommendations for future research to be made.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jimenez-Puente, Alberto</author><author>Garcia-Alegria, Javier</author><author>Gomez-Aracena, Jorge</author><author>Hidalgo-Rojas, Luis</author><author>Lorenzo-Nogueiras, Luisa</author><author>Perea-Milla-Lopez, Emilio</author><author>Fernandez-Crehuet-Navajas, Joaquin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Readmission rate as an indicator of hospital performance: The case of Spain</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care</full-title></periodical><pages>385-391</pages><volume>20</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Cross-Sectional Studies</keyword><keyword>Health Care</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Quality Indicators</keyword><keyword>Regression Analysis</keyword><keyword>Spain</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year></dates><pub-location>Costa del Sol Hospital</pub-location><publisher>Cambridge University Press</publisher><isbn>0266-4623</isbn><accession-num>15446771</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=emed6&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=2004350017</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>OBJECTIVES: Hospital readmission rate is currently used as a quality of care indicator, although its validity has not been established. Our aims were to identify the frequency and characteristics of potential avoidable readmissions and to compare the assessment of quality of care derived from readmission rate with other measure of quality (judgment of experts). METHODS: DESIGN: cross-sectional observational study; SETTING: acute care hospital located in Marbella, South of Spain; STUDY PARTICIPANTS: random sample of patients readmitted at the hospital within six months from discharge (n = 363); INTERVENTIONS: review of clinical records by a pair of observers to assess the causes of readmissions and their potential avoidability; MAIN MEASURES: logistic regression analysis to identify the variables from the databases of hospital discharges which are related to avoidability of readmissions. Determination of sensitivity and specificity of different definitions of readmission rate to detect avoidable situations. RESULTS: Nineteen percent of readmissions were considered potentially avoidable. Variables related to readmission avoidability were (i) time elapsed between index admission and readmission and (ii) difference in diagnoses of both episodes. None of the definitions of readmission rate used in this study provided adequate values of sensitivity and specificity in the identification of potentially avoidable readmissions. CONCLUSIONS: Most readmissions in our hospital were unavoidable. Thus, readmission rate might not be considered a valid indicator of quality of care.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Swart, E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>[What do we conclude from re-admissions about quality of inpatient care?].</title><secondary-title>Gesundheitswesen (Bundesverband der Arzte des Offentlichen Gesundheitsdienstes (Germany))</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Gesundheitswesen (Bundesverband der Arzte des Offentlichen Gesundheitsdienstes (Germany))</full-title></periodical><pages>101-106</pages><volume>67</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Delivery of Health Care</keyword><keyword>Germany</keyword><keyword>Hospitalization</keyword><keyword>Inpatients</keyword><keyword>Insurance Claim Reporting</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Quality Assurance, Health Care</keyword><keyword>Quality of Health Care</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year></dates><accession-num>15747196</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1055/s-2005-857880</electronic-resource-num><language>ger</language><urls/><abstract>Quality assurance in hospital care increasingly focuses on evaluation of outcome. Problems arise with displaying results of medical care beyond discharge. In this context hospital readmissions are often used as outcome variable. But it is unclear whether readmissions are meaningful indices of quality of hospital care and if so, where to get valid data on readmissions. We used claims data of the regional health insurance fund in Saxony-Anhalt (AOK Saxony-Anhalt) from 2002 and 2003 (850,000 insured; nearly 300,000 cases per year). All hospital admissions of a insured person are identified by an anonymous id-number independent of the admitting hospital. By this way we can analyze readmissions individually. Readmission are frequent events in hospital care. Nearly one third of all patients were admitted at least a second time in 2003. 18 % of all hospital cases are readmissions within 30 days after discharge. Readmissions concentrated on chronically ill, oncological, or multimorbid patients. Many of the readmissions take place in the context of planned therapies or post-operative treatment. 'Revolving-door patients' with multiple readmissions point to problems in cooperation of ambulatory and hospital care. By defining tracer diagnoses and specific causes of readmissions unplanned readmissions may be identified as a quality indicator of suboptimal care. Readmissions don't express suboptimal care per se. But taking into account methodological aspects a tracer approach with defining specific unplanned readmissions may provide meaningful outcome indicators. These can be derived from claims data fast, routinely, and with low costs. Further validation of the approach is needed.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Halfon, Patricia</author><author>Eggli, Yves</author><author>Pretre-Rohrbach, Isaline</author><author>Meylan, Danielle</author><author>Marazzi, Alfio</author><author>Burnand, Bernard</author><author>P., Halfon</author><author>Y., Eggli</author><author>I., Pretre-Rohrbach</author><author>D., Meylan</author><author>A., Marazzi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Validation of the potentially avoidable hospital readmission rate as a routine indicator of the quality of hospital care</title><secondary-title>Medical Care</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Medical Care</full-title></periodical><pages>972-981</pages><volume>44</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>*health care quality</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*medical error</keyword><keyword>80 and over</keyword><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Age Factors</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Algorithms</keyword><keyword>Chi-Square Distribution</keyword><keyword>Child</keyword><keyword>Confidence Intervals</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Health Care</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Infant</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Medical Errors</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Models</keyword><keyword>Newborn</keyword><keyword>Patient Discharge</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Poisson Distribution</keyword><keyword>Poisson distribution</keyword><keyword>Preschool</keyword><keyword>Quality Indicators</keyword><keyword>ROC Curve</keyword><keyword>Risk Adjustment</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Switzerland</keyword><keyword>Theoretical</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>adolescent</keyword><keyword>adult</keyword><keyword>age</keyword><keyword>aged</keyword><keyword>algorithm</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>chi square distribution</keyword><keyword>child</keyword><keyword>comparative study</keyword><keyword>confidence interval</keyword><keyword>evaluation</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>hospital discharge</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>infant</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>middle aged</keyword><keyword>newborn</keyword><keyword>preschool child</keyword><keyword>risk assessment</keyword><keyword>risk factor</keyword><keyword>roc curve</keyword><keyword>statistics</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>theoretical model</keyword><keyword>time</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year></dates><pub-location>P.

However, most commonly used measures raise conceptual issues. OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate the usefulness of the computerized algorithm for identifying avoidable readmissions on the basis of minimum bias, criterion validity, and measurement precision. RESEARCH DESIGN AND SUBJECTS: A total of 131,809 hospitalizations of patients discharged alive from 49 hospitals were used to compare the predictive performance of risk adjustment methods. A subset of a random sample of 570 medical records of discharge/readmission pairs in 12 hospitals were reviewed to estimate the predictive value of the screening of potentially avoidable readmissions. MEASURES: Potentially avoidable readmissions, defined as readmissions related to a condition of the previous hospitalization and not expected as part of a program of care and occurring within 30 days after the previous discharge, were identified by a computerized algorithm. Unavoidable readmissions were considered as censored events. RESULTS: A total of 5.2% of hospitalizations were followed by a potentially avoidable readmission, 17% of them in a different hospital. The predictive value of the screen was 78%; 27% of screened readmissions were judged clearly avoidable. The correlation between the hospital rate of clearly avoidable readmission and all readmissions rate, potentially avoidable readmissions rate or the ratio of observed to expected readmissions were respectively 0.42, 0.56 and 0.66. Adjustment models using clinical information performed better. CONCLUSION: Adjusted rates of potentially avoidable readmissions are scientifically sound enough to warrant their inclusion in hospital quality surveillance. © 2006 Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, Inc.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Demir, Eren</author><author>Chaussalet, Thierry J</author><author>Xie, Haifeng</author><author>Millard, Peter H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Emergency readmission criterion: a technique for determining the emergency readmission time window</title><secondary-title>IEEE transactions on information technology in biomedicine : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>IEEE transactions on information technology in biomedicine : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society</full-title></periodical><pages>644-649</pages><volume>12</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Chronic Obstructive</keyword><keyword>Emergency Service</keyword><keyword>England</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Hospital</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Length of Stay</keyword><keyword>Outcome Assessment (Health Care)</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Disease</keyword><keyword>Recurrence</keyword><keyword>Risk Assessment</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Stroke</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><pub-location>E.

Yet in the literature, shorter and longer periods such as 14 days or 90-180 days have also been suggested. In this paper, we develop a modeling approach that systematically tackles the issue surrounding the appropriate choice of a time window as a definition of readmission. The approach is based on the intuitive idea that patients who are discharged from hospital can be broadly divided in to two groups-a group that is at high risk of readmission and a group that is at low risk. Using the national data (England), we demonstrate the usefulness of the approach in the case of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke, and congestive heart failure (CHF) patients, which are known to be the leading causes of early readmission. Our findings suggest that there are marked differences in the optimal width of the time window for COPD, stroke, and CHF patients. Furthermore, time windows and the probabilities of being in the high-risk group for COPD, stroke, and CHF patients for each of the 29 acute and specialist trusts in the London area indicate wide variability between hospitals. The novelty of this modeling approach lies in its ability to define an appropriate time window based on evidence objectively derived from operational data. Therefore, it can separately provide a unique approach in examining variability between hospitals, and potentially contribute to a better definition of readmission as a performance indicator.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Balla, Uri</author><author>Malnick, Stephen</author><author>Schattner, Ami</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Early readmissions to the department of medicine as a screening tool for monitoring quality of care problems.</title><secondary-title>Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>294-300</pages><volume>87</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Case-Control Studies</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Israel</keyword><keyword>Length of Stay</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mass Screening</keyword><keyword>Patient Discharge</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Quality of Health Care</keyword><keyword>Single-Blind Method</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><pub-location>A.

We examined the utility of hospital readmissions for this purpose in a prospective case-control study in a large academic medical center in Israel. All patients with nonelective readmissions to 2 departments of medicine within 30 days of discharge were interviewed, and their medical records were carefully examined with emphasis on the index admission. Patient data were compared to data for age- and sex-matched controls (n = 140) who were not readmitted. Medical records of readmitted and control patients were blindly evaluated by 2 senior clinicians who independently identified potential quality of care (QOC) problems during the index admission. Inhospital and late mortality was determined 6 months after discharge.Over a period of 3 months there were 1988 urgent admissions; 1913 discharges and subsequently 271 unplanned readmissions occurred (14.1% of discharges). Readmissions occurred an average of 10 days after discharge, and readmitted patients were sicker than controls (mean, 4.3 vs. 3.3 diagnoses per patient), although their length of stay was similarly short (3.4 +/- 2.8 d). Analysis of all readmissions revealed QOC problems in 90/271 (33%) of readmissions, 4.5% of hospitalizations. All were deemed preventable. Interobserver agreement was good (83%, kappa = 0.67). Among matched controls, only 8/140 admissions revealed QOC problems (6%, p &lt; 0.001) (k = 0.77). The preventable readmissions mostly involved a vascular event or congestive heart failure; they occurred within a mean of 10 +/- 8 days of the index admission, and their inpatient mortality was 6.7% vs. 1.7% among readmissions that had no QOC problems (odds ratio, 4.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-16.7). The main pitfalls identified during the index admission included incomplete workup (33%), too short hospital stay (31%), inappropriate medication (44%), diagnostic error (16%), and disregarding a significant laboratory result (12%). In many patients more than 1 pitfall was identified (mean, 1.5 per patient). Risk factors for preventable readmission include older age and living in an institution (p &lt; 0.05). Almost two-thirds of the readmitted patients with QOC problems were discharged after spending 2 days or fewer at the hospital. In conclusion, unplanned readmissions within 30 days of discharge are frequent, more prevalent in sicker patients, and possibly associated with increased mortality. In a third of readmitted patients a QOC problem can be identified, and these problems are preventable. Thus, readmission may be used as a screening tool for potential QOC problems in the department of medicine. Routine monitoring of all readmissions may provide a simple cost-effective means of identifying and addressing medical mistakes.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Goldfield, Norbert I</author><author>McCullough, Elizabeth C</author><author>Hughes, John S</author><author>Tang, Ana M</author><author>Eastman, Beth</author><author>Rawlins, Lisa K</author><author>Averill, Richard F</author><author>N.I., Goldfield</author><author>E.C., McCullough</author><author>J.S., Hughes</author><author>A.M., Tang</author><author>B., Eastman</author><author>L.K., Rawlins</author><author>F, Averill R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identifying potentially preventable readmissions</title><secondary-title>Health Care Financing Review</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Health Care Financing Review</full-title></periodical><pages>75-91</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>*health care cost</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*preventive health service</keyword><keyword>Diagnosis-Related Groups</keyword><keyword>Florida</keyword><keyword>Forecasting</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Quality of Health Care</keyword><keyword>Risk Assessment</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>controlled study</keyword><keyword>disease severity</keyword><keyword>health care management</keyword><keyword>health care quality</keyword><keyword>hospital admission</keyword><keyword>hospital cost</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>statistical model</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year></dates><pub-location>N.

The PPR logic determines whether the reason for readmission is clinically related to a prior admission, and therefore potentially preventable. The likelihood of a PPR was found to be dependent on severity of illness, extremes of age, and the presence of mental health diagnoses. Analyses using PPRs show that readmission rates increase with increasing severity of illness and increasing time between admission and readmission, vary by the type of prior admission, and are stable within hospitals over time.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Phelan, D</author><author>Smyth, L</author><author>Ryder, M</author><author>Murphy, N</author><author>O'Loughlin, C</author><author>Conlon, C</author><author>Ledwidge, M</author><author>McDonald, K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Can we reduce preventable heart failure readmissions in patients enrolled in a Disease Management Programme?</title><secondary-title>Irish Journal of Medical Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Irish Journal of Medical Science</full-title></periodical><pages>167-171</pages><volume>178</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Disease Management</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Ireland</keyword><keyword>Length of Stay</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Prognosis</keyword><keyword>Program Evaluation</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year></dates><pub-location>K.

However, there remain a number of patients enrolled in a DMP who are readmitted with HF. The primary aim of the study was to determine the proportion of preventable readmissions (PR). The secondary aim was to recognise patient characteristics which would identify certain patients at risk of having a PR. METHODS: A retrospective chart search was performed on patients readmitted over a 1-year period. RESULTS: 38.5% of readmissions were classified as PR. None of these patients made prior contact with the DMP. Admission levels of BNP, potassium, urea and creatinine were significantly lower in the PR group. CONCLUSION: DMP have proven benefits in reducing hospital readmission nonetheless a significant proportion of these readmissions are preventable. Further work is required to prospectively analyse why these patients fail to contact the DMP.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yam, Carrie H K</author><author>Wong, Eliza L Y</author><author>Chan, Frank W K</author><author>Leung, Michael C M</author><author>Wong, Fiona Y Y</author><author>Cheung, Annie W L</author><author>Yeoh, E K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Avoidable readmission in Hong Kong--system, clinician, patient or social factor?</title><secondary-title>BMC health services research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC health services research</full-title></periodical><pages>311</pages><volume>10</volume><keywords><keyword>Cohort Studies</keyword><keyword>Cost-Benefit Analysis</keyword><keyword>Delivery of Health Care</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Health Services Research</keyword><keyword>Hong Kong</keyword><keyword>Hospital Costs</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Inpatients</keyword><keyword>Length of Stay</keyword><keyword>Logistic Models</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Multivariate Analysis</keyword><keyword>Needs Assessment</keyword><keyword>Patient Admission</keyword><keyword>Patient Discharge</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Physicians'</keyword><keyword>Poisson Distribution</keyword><keyword>Practice Patterns</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Socioeconomic Factors</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>Unnecessary Procedures</keyword><keyword>economics</keyword><keyword>organization &amp; administration</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><pub-location>C.H.

It is essential to profile the prevalence of avoidable readmissions and understand its drivers so as to develop possible interventions for reducing readmissions that are preventable. The aim of this study is to identify the magnitude of avoidable readmissions, its contributing factors and costs in Hong Kong. METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 332,453 inpatient admissions in the Medical specialty in public hospital system in Hong Kong in year 2007. A stratified random sample of patients with unplanned readmission within 30 days after discharge was selected for medical record reviews. Eight physicians reviewed patients' medical records and classified whether a readmission was avoidable according to an assessment checklist. The results were correlated with hospital inpatient data. RESULTS: It was found that 40.8% of the 603 unplanned readmissions were judged avoidable by the reviewers. Avoidable readmissions were due to: clinician factor (42.3%) including low threshold for admission and premature discharge etc.; patient factor (including medical and health factor) (41.9%) such as relapse or progress of previous complaint, and compliance problems etc., followed by system factor (14.6%) including inadequate discharge planning, inadequate palliative care/terminal care, etc., and social factor (1.2%) such as carer system, lack of support and community services. After adjusting for patients' age, gender, principal diagnosis at previous discharge and readmission hospitals, the risk factors for avoidable readmissions in the total population i.e. all acute care admissions irrespective of whether there was a readmission or not, included patients with a longer length of stay, and with higher number of hospitalizations and attendance in public outpatient clinics and Accident and Emergency departments in the past 12 months. In the analysis of only unplanned readmissions, it was found that the concordance of the principal diagnosis for admission and readmission, and shorter time period between discharge and readmission were associated with avoidable readmissions. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that almost half of the readmissions could have been prevented. They had been mainly due to clinician and patient factors, in particular, both of which were intimately related to clinical management and patient care. These readmissions could be prevented by a system of ongoing clinical review to examine the clinical practice/decision for discharge, and improving clinical care and enhancing patient knowledge of the early warning signs for relapse. The importance of adequate and appropriate ambulatory care to support the patients in the community was also a key finding to reduce avoidable readmissions. Education on patient self-management should also be enhanced to minimize the patient factors with regard to avoidable readmission. Our findings thus provide important insights into the development of an effective discharge planning system which should place patients and carers as the primacy focus of care by engaging them along with the healthcare professionals in the whole discharge planning process.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yam, Carrie H K</author><author>Wong, Eliza L Y</author><author>Chan, Frank W K</author><author>Wong, Fiona Y Y</author><author>Leung, Michael C M</author><author>Yeoh, E K</author><author>C.H.K., Yam</author><author>E.L.Y., Wong</author><author>F.W.K., Chan</author><author>F.Y.Y., Wong</author><author>M.C.M., Leung</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Measuring and preventing potentially avoidable hospital readmissions: a review of the literature.</title><secondary-title>Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi / Hong Kong Academy of Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hong Kong medical journal = Xianggang yi xue za zhi / Hong Kong Academy of Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>383-389</pages><volume>16</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Patient Discharge</keyword><keyword>Patient Education as Topic</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>follow up</keyword><keyword>health care system</keyword><keyword>home care</keyword><keyword>hospital admission</keyword><keyword>hospital discharge</keyword><keyword>medical literature</keyword><keyword>medical record review</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>patient counseling</keyword><keyword>patient education</keyword><keyword>review</keyword><keyword>risk factor</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><pub-location>C.

Data sources and Literature search using Medline, PubMed and the Cochrane extraction Library up to June 2010, using the terms &quot;avoidable&quot;, &quot;preventable&quot;, &quot;unplanned&quot;, &quot;unnecessary&quot;, &quot;readmission&quot;, and &quot;rehospitalization&quot;. Study selection A total of 48 original papers and review articles were selected for inclusion in this review. Data synthesis Although hospital readmission seemed to be a term commonly used as an outcome indicator in many studies, it is difficult to make valid comparison of results from different studies. This is because the definitions of terms, methods of data collection, and approaches to data analysis differ greatly. The following criteria for studying hospital readmissions have been recommended: (a) identify hospital admissions and define relevant terms, (b) establish a clinical diagnosis for a readmission; (c) establish the purpose for a readmission, (d) set a discharge-to-readmission timeframe, and (e) identify the sources of information for assessing readmissions. Studies to identify avoidable readmissions usually involve medical records and chart reviews by clinicians using the classification scheme developed by the authors. The proportion of all readmissions assessed as preventable varies from 9 to 59% depending on the population of patients studied, duration of follow-up, type and methodology of the study and case-mix-related factors. A number of studies classified risk factors for readmission into four categories: patient, social, clinical, and ystem factors. Home-based interventions, intensive education/ counselling, multidisciplinary care approaches, and telephone follow-up were the main types of interventions to address potentially avoidable readmissions. Conclusions A standard instrument to identify avoidable readmission is important in enabling valid comparisons within the system and at different timelines, so as to permit robust evaluation of interventions. The assessment of preventable risk factors for readmissions also provides a basis for designing and implementing intervention programmes.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>B., Cakir</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluating readmission rates: How can we improve?</title><secondary-title>Southern Medical Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Southern Medical Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>1079-1083</pages><volume>103</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>Caucasian</keyword><keyword>acute kidney failure</keyword><keyword>adult</keyword><keyword>anemia</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>cerebrovascular accident</keyword><keyword>chronic obstructive lung disease</keyword><keyword>comorbidity</keyword><keyword>congestive heart failure</keyword><keyword>coronary artery disease</keyword><keyword>diabetes mellitus</keyword><keyword>diabetic ketoacidosis</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>follow up</keyword><keyword>gastrointestinal hemorrhage</keyword><keyword>heart arrhythmia</keyword><keyword>hospital admission</keyword><keyword>hospital discharge</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>hypertension</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>major clinical study</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>medical record review</keyword><keyword>mortality</keyword><keyword>nausea and vomiting</keyword><keyword>patient education</keyword><keyword>peripheral vascular disease</keyword><keyword>pneumonia</keyword><keyword>retrospective study</keyword><keyword>sepsis</keyword><keyword>transient ischemic attack</keyword><keyword>urinary tract infection</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year></dates><pub-location>B.

Methods: We conducted a retrospective medical chart review on patients who were rehospitalized with the same diagnosis within 30 days over a period of one year. Results: Among 5,206 patients who were admitted to the hospitalist service over one year, 85 (1.6%) were rehospitalized within 30 days due to the same condition. Of the 85 readmitted patients, 47% were male and 82% were Caucasian, with a mean age of 58 +/- 17 years. The top diagnoses were pneumonia, sepsis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Follow-up appointments were made for only 27% of patients at first admission. Ninety percent of patients received an accurate medication list at discharge. Mortality within three months was higher in patients with sepsis, more comorbidities, longer length of stay at first hospitalization, and those discharged to a nursing home after readmission. Only 4.7% of readmissions were concluded to be preventable. Conclusion: Our readmission rate (1.6%) is significantly lower than that of previous studies (23.2%), as we included the readmissions only due to the same diagnosis. Patient education, family involvement in discharge process, and scheduling follow-up appointments could potentially reduce readmissions, despite multiple unmodifiable factors. We suspect all-cause readmissions have room for more improvement, which should be the focus of intervention.

We re viewed urgent readmissions to determine which were potentially avoidable and compared rates of all-cause and avoidable readmissions. Methods: In a multicentre, prospective cohort study, we reviewed all urgent readmissions that occurred within six months among pa tients discharged to the community from 11 teaching and community hospitals between October 2002 and July 2006. Summaries of the readmissions were reviewed by at least four practising physicians using standardized methods to judge whether the readmission was an adverse event (poor clinical outcome due to medical care) and whether the adverse event could have been avoided. We used a latent class model to determine whether the probability that each readmission was truly avoidable exceeded 50%. Results: Of the 4812 patients included in the study, 649 (13.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 12.5%-14.5%) had an urgent readmission within six months after discharge. We considered 104 of them (16.0% of those readmitted, 95% CI 13.3%-19.1%; 2.2% of those discharged, 95% CI 1.8%-2.6%) to have had a potentially avoidable readmission. The proportion of patients who had an urgent readmission varied significantly by hospital (range 7.5%-22.5%; chi2 = 92.9, p &lt; 0.001); the proportion of readmissions deemed avoidable did not show significant variation by hospital (range 1.2%-3.7%; chi2 = 12.5, p &lt; 0.25). We found no association between the proportion of patients who had an urgent readmission and the proportion of patients who had an avoidable readmission (Pearson correlation 0.294; p = 0.38). In addition, we found no association between hospital rankings by proportion of patients readmitted and rankings by proportion of patients with an avoidable readmission (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.28, p = 0.41). Interpretation: Urgent readmissions deemed potentially avoidable were relatively uncommon, comprising less than 20% of all urgent readmissions following hospital discharge. Hospital-specific proportions of patients who were readmitted were not related to pro portions with a potentially avoidable readmission. © 2011 Canadian Medical Association or its licensors.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>C, van Walraven</author><author>Bennett, C</author><author>Jennings, A</author><author>PC, Austin</author><author>AJ, Forster</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Proportion of hospital readmissions deemed avoidable: a systematic review.</title><secondary-title>CMAJ: Canadian Medical Association Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CMAJ: Canadian Medical Association Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>E391-402 1p</pages><volume>183</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Clinical Indicators -- Standards</keyword><keyword>Clinical Indicators -- Statistics and Numerical Da</keyword><keyword>Human</keyword><keyword>Readmission -- Standards</keyword><keyword>Readmission -- Statistics and Numerical Data</keyword><keyword>Regression</keyword><keyword>Systematic Review</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><pub-location>Ottowa, Ontario</pub-location><publisher>8872147 Canada Inc.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1503/cmaj.101860</electronic-resource-num><notes>Accession Number: 104873971.

We conducted a systematic review of studies that measured the proportion of readmissions deemed avoidable. We examined how such readmissions were measured and estimated their prevalence. Methods: We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases to identify all studies published from 1966 to July 2010 that reviewed hospital readmissions and that specified how many were classified as avoidable. Results: Our search strategy identified 34 studies. Three of the studies used combinations of administrative diagnostic codes to determine whether readmissions were avoidable. Criteria used in the remaining studies were subjective. Most of the studies were conducted at single teaching hospitals, did not consider information from the community or treating physicians, and used only one reviewer to decide whether readmissions were avoidable. The median proportion of readmissions deemed avoidable was 27.1% but varied from 5% to 79%. Three study-level factors (teaching status of hospital, whether all diagnoses or only some were considered, and length of follow-up) were significantly associated with the proportion of admissions deemed to be avoidable and explained some, but not all, of the heterogeneity between the studies. Interpretation: All but three of the studies used subjective criteria to determine whether readmissions were avoidable. Study methods had notable deficits and varied extensively, as did the proportion of readmissions deemed avoidable. The true proportion of hospital readmissions that are potentially avoidable remains unclear.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Walraven, Carl</author><author>Austin, Peter C</author><author>Forster, Alan J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Urgent readmission rates can be used to infer differences in avoidable readmission rates between hospitals</title><secondary-title>Journal of Clinical Epidemiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Clinical Epidemiology</full-title></periodical><pages>1124-1130</pages><volume>65</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Benchmarking</keyword><keyword>Emergencies</keyword><keyword>Health Care</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Models</keyword><keyword>Monte Carlo Method</keyword><keyword>Ontario</keyword><keyword>Outcome Assessment (Health Care)</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Quality Indicators</keyword><keyword>Statistical</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><pub-location>C.

This study developed a method that used observed urgent readmission rates to compare the latent avoidable readmission rates between the two hospitals. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: To compare two hospitals, we identified all proportions of urgent readmissions deemed avoidable at each hospital making their avoidable readmission rates significantly different. We then calculated the probability that any of these conditions occurred. We applied this method to 25 randomly selected Ontario acute-care hospitals in 2008. RESULTS: The hospitals had a median 30-day urgent readmission rate of 10.8% (interquartile [IQR] 9.7-12.8%). The median P-value of the 300 hospital-hospital comparisons for 30-day urgent readmission rate was 0.05 (interquartile range [IQR] 0.0005-0.31). In contrast, the median probability that hospitals with the lower urgent 30-day readmission rate outperformed their comparator hospital with respect to avoidable readmissions was only 0.161 (IQR 0.079-0.274). CONCLUSION: Urgent readmission rates can be used to estimate the probability that avoidable readmission rates differ significantly between the two hospitals. The probability that avoidable readmission rates differ significantly between hospitals is small even when significant differences in urgent 30-day readmission rates exist. Our results show that 30-day urgent readmission rates should be used very cautiously to compare hospital quality of care.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bianco, Aida</author><author>Mole, Antonio</author><author>Nobile, Carmelo G A</author><author>Di Giuseppe, Gabriella</author><author>Pileggi, Claudia</author><author>Angelillo, Italo F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hospital Readmission Prevalence and Analysis of Those Potentially Avoidable in Southern Italy</title><secondary-title>PLoS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS ONE</full-title></periodical><pages>no pagination</pages><volume>7</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>80 and over</keyword><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Cost-Benefit Analysis</keyword><keyword>Cross-Sectional Studies</keyword><keyword>Evidence-Based Medicine</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Inpatients</keyword><keyword>Italy</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Multivariate Analysis</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Prevalence</keyword><keyword>Quality of Health Care</keyword><keyword>Regression Analysis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><pub-location>I.

The purposes of the study were to measure the prevalence of hospital readmissions, to identify possible factors that influence such readmission and to measure the prevalence of readmissions potentially avoidable in Italy. METHODS: A sample of 2289 medical records of patients aged 18 and over admitted for medical or surgical illness at one 502-bed community non-teaching hospital were randomly selected. RESULTS: A total of 2252 patients were included in the final analysis, equaling a response rate of 98.4%. The overall hospital readmission prevalence within 30 days of discharge was 10.2%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the proportion of patients readmitted within 30 days of discharge significantly increased regardless of Charlson et al. comorbidity score, among unemployed or retired patients, and in patients in general surgery. A total of 43.7% hospital readmissions were judged to be potentially avoidable. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that potentially avoidable readmissions were significantly higher in general surgery, in patients referred to hospital by an emergency department physician, and in those with a shortened time between discharge and readmission. CONCLUSION: Additional research on intervention or bundle of interventions applicable to acute inpatient populations that aim to reduce potentially avoidable readmissions is strongly needed, and health care providers are urged to implement evidence-based programs for more cost-effective delivery of health care.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Walraven, Carl</author><author>Wong, Jenna</author><author>Hawken, Steven</author><author>Forster, Alan J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparing methods to calculate hospital-specific rates of early death or urgent readmission.</title><secondary-title>CMAJ</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CMAJ</full-title></periodical><pages>E810-7 1p</pages><volume>184</volume><issue>15</issue><keywords><keyword>*hospital patient</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*mortality</keyword><keyword>Canada</keyword><keyword>Clinical Indicators</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Health Care</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Mortality</keyword><keyword>Ontario</keyword><keyword>Outcome Assessment</keyword><keyword>Outcome Assessment (Health Care)</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Quality Indicators</keyword><keyword>Readmission -- Statistics and Numerical Data</keyword><keyword>adult</keyword><keyword>age</keyword><keyword>aged</keyword><keyword>analytic method</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>gender</keyword><keyword>hospital discharge</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>intermethod comparison</keyword><keyword>major clinical study</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>measurement</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><pub-location>Ottowa, Ontario</pub-location><publisher>8872147 Canada Inc.</publisher><isbn>0820-3946</isbn><accession-num>23048081</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1503/cmaj.120801</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 2 (Comparing methods to calculate hospital-specific rates of early death or urgent readmission. - C, van Walraven; Wong, J; Hawken, S; AJ, Forster)

Hospital-specific readmission rates have been reported as a quality-of-care indicator. However, the extent to which these measures vary with different calculation methods is uncertain. Methods: We identified all discharges from Ontario hospitals from 2005 to 2010 and determined whether patients died or were urgently readmitted within 30 days. For each hospital, we calculated 4 distinct observed-to-expected ratios, estimating the expected number of events using different adjustments for confounders (age and sex v. complete) and different units of analysis (all admissions v. single admission per patient). Results: We included 3 148 648 admissions to hospital for 1 802 704 patients in 162 hospitals. Ratios adjusted for age and sex alone had the greatest variation. Within hospitals, ranges of the 4 ratios averaged 31% of the overall estimate. Readmission ratios adjusted for age and sex showed the lowest correlation (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.48-0.68). Hospital rankings based on the different measures had an average range of 47.4 (standard deviation 32.2) out of 162. Interpretation: We found notable variation in rates of death or urgent readmission within 30 days based on the extent of adjustment for confounders and the unit of analysis. Slight changes in the methods used to calculate hospital-specific readmission rates influence their values and the consequent rankings of hospitals. Our results highlight the caution required when comparing hospital performance using rates of death or urgent readmission within 30 days. © 2012 Canadian Medical Association or its licensors.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J, Lee</author><author>S, Pickering</author><author>C, Cutugno</author><author>M, Press</author><author>M, Unterbrink</author><author>M.E, Kelser</author><author>J, Richardson</author><author>J., Lee</author><author>S., Pickering</author><author>C., Cutugno</author><author>M., Press</author><author>M., Unterbrink</author><author>M.E., Kelser</author><author>J., Richardson</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identifying preventable readmissions: An interdisciplinary approach to building a conceptual model</title><secondary-title>Journal of Hospital Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Hospital Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>S8</pages><volume>7</volume><keywords><keyword>*hospital</keyword><keyword>*model</keyword><keyword>*society</keyword><keyword>consensus</keyword><keyword>grounded theory</keyword><keyword>hospital patient</keyword><keyword>hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>information processing</keyword><keyword>interdisciplinary research</keyword><keyword>nurse</keyword><keyword>outpatient</keyword><keyword>patient</keyword><keyword>physician</keyword><keyword>qualitative research</keyword><keyword>risk</keyword><keyword>scientist</keyword><keyword>semi structured interview</keyword><keyword>social worker</keyword><keyword>validity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><pub-location>J.

The problem is compounded by the lack of consensus on the defining criteria for preventable readmissions. We sought to define a comprehensive conceptual model that classified the etiologic subtypes of readmissions by incorporating the perspectives of patients, family, and the full spectrum of providers. Methods: We formed an interdisciplinary research team (physicians, nurses, researchers, and nonmedical staff) and used qualitative research methods based on grounded theory to conduct semistructured interviews and focus groups with readmitted patients and their &quot;care circle&quot; (families, hospital and home nurses, inpatient and outpatient physicians, and hospital social workers). These were conducted and audiotaped by members of the research team not directly involved with the patients' care. Responses were iteratively reviewed and coded to design a conceptual model detailing possible causes for readmission. To enhance validity, we triangulated findings using the overlapping perspectives of subjects and researchers to arrive at a comprehensive set of themes associated with readmission to a hospital. Results: We identified five primary categories depicted in the conceptual model below. These categories were identified as mechanisms through which the care circle could be disrupted, potentially increasing the risk of readmission. Conclusions: Readmissions are multifactorial, but preventability remains poorly defined. Our conceptual model provides a comprehensive set of categories that contributes to readmission based on the perspectives of the complete care circle. Our next step is to assess the preventability of these issues, so that efforts to reduce readmissions can focus on (Figure presented) these components as well as strengthen the linkages in the care circle.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M., Janjigian</author><author>D., Burke Bails</author><author>D., Burke Bails</author><author>M, Janjigian</author><author>D, Burke Bails</author><author>D, Burke Bails</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Factors contributing to 7-day readmissions in an urban teaching hospital</title><secondary-title>Journal of Hospital Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Hospital Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>S38</pages><volume>7</volume><keywords><keyword>*hospital</keyword><keyword>*society</keyword><keyword>*teaching hospital</keyword><keyword>algorithm</keyword><keyword>classification</keyword><keyword>consensus</keyword><keyword>data base</keyword><keyword>gender</keyword><keyword>health care</keyword><keyword>hospital patient</keyword><keyword>hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>medical record review</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>patient</keyword><keyword>patient compliance</keyword><keyword>physician</keyword><keyword>pilot study</keyword><keyword>prediction</keyword><keyword>reimbursement</keyword><keyword>risk</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><pub-location>M.

Most existing risk prediction models rely on administrative databases and have poor predictive ability. Physician chart reviews are necessary to identify both the cause and preventability of a readmission. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of 135 patients with an unplanned (Table presented) readmission to Bellevue Hospital within 7 days of discharge from the medicine service during a six month period. Each chart was reviewed independently by two experienced attending physicians. Using an algorithm developed via a pilot study, each readmission was classified into one of five categories: (1) not medically necessary (medical necessity), (2) following a discharge against medical advice (AMA), (3) related to a deficiency in the discharge process, (4) related to poor patient adherence (patient behavior) to the discharge plan, or (5) related to a condition that was difficult to predict. The latter three categories were further subcategorized to allow for more detailed analysis. Discrepancies in classification were resolved by consensus of the four authors. Baseline demographic information was obtained for the same time frame for patients who were not readmitted within 7 days. Results: During the study period there were 265 patients who were readmitted within seven days of discharge and 3,411 patients who were not. The gender ratio was not significantly different between groups (65% male in the readmitted group versus 62% male in the not readmitted group, P = 0.47). Age was significantly lower in the readmitted group (mean = 52.9 years) as compared to the not readmitted group (56.3; P = 0.001). Median length of stay (LOS) for the initial hospitalization was longer in the readmitted group (5 days vs 3 days; P = 0.0002). For the 135 readmitted cases, there was good agreement between reviewers (84%; j 0.776). The most common category of readmission was &quot;unpredictable&quot; (37.8%), followed by patient behavior (22.2%), discharge process (21.5%), medical necessity (9.6%), and AMA (8.9%). Conclusions: Our novel algorithm efficiently and reproducibly classified 7-day readmissions into discreet categories. Compared to all other patients, those who were readmitted within 7 days were more likely to be younger and have a longer initial LOS. We found 62% of readmissions were attributable to physician or patient behaviors, or system failures. This categorization algorithm can be used to guide creation of risk prediction models and allows for detailed analysis of individual groups that will assist development of individualized interventions to reduce rates of avoidable readmissions.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>N., Egorova</author><author>P., Vaishnava</author><author>M.B., Lipani</author><author>D., Ricks</author><author>C., Colgan</author><author>S., Bernstein</author><author>I., Nash</author><author>A., Gelijns</author><author>A., Moskowitz</author><author>N, Egorova</author><author>P, Vaishnava</author><author>M.B, Lipani</author><author>D, Ricks</author><author>C, Colgan</author><author>S, Bernstein</author><author>I, Nash</author><author>A, Gelijns</author><author>A, Moskowitz</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Validating the identification of patients at high risk for readmission by examining hospitalization history</title><secondary-title>Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes</full-title></periodical><pages>no pagination-no pagination</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>3 SUPPL. 1</issue><keywords><keyword>*cardiovascular disease</keyword><keyword>*cerebrovascular accident</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*hospitalization</keyword><keyword>*human</keyword><keyword>*outcomes research</keyword><keyword>*patient</keyword><keyword>*prediction</keyword><keyword>*risk</keyword><keyword>alcohol abuse</keyword><keyword>breast cancer</keyword><keyword>custody</keyword><keyword>diseases</keyword><keyword>high risk patient</keyword><keyword>hip fracture</keyword><keyword>hospital</keyword><keyword>intermedin</keyword><keyword>logistic regression analysis</keyword><keyword>medicare</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>morbidity</keyword><keyword>osteoporosis</keyword><keyword>patient identification</keyword><keyword>primary medical care</keyword><keyword>social worker</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><pub-location>N.

BACKGROUND: There is a federal mandate to reduce preventable readmissions. Predicting hospital readmission risk is of great interest to identify which patients would benefit most from transition interventions. Current models perform poorly. Mount Sinai Hospital (MSH) has implemented the Preventable Admissions Care Team (PACT), which has achieved significant results for patients not targeted by other transitional programs. PACT, a social worker-led transitional program, decreased 30-day readmission rate from 30% to 12%, ED visits by 63%, and achieved a 90% primary care show rate at 7-10-days post-discharge. Patients are identified for PACT solely by readmission history: one readmission in 30 days or 2 in 6 months, prior to the index hospitalization. Thus, our objective here was to determine the concordance of predictions based on hospitalization history with a more formal risk model based on factors that characterize patients through demographics and comorbidities. METHODS: Using logistic regression, we developed a risk prediction model for readmission within 30-days. The model, which used patient demographics and co-morbidities (alcohol abuse, AMI, afib, breast cancer, CKD, COPD, CVA, depression, hip fracture, or osteoporosis), was developed in a cohort of Medicare FFS beneficiaries with a high proportion of cardiovascular disease, hospitalized at MSH. The higher the risk score, the higher risk of readmission. Scores of 0-2 had a 7% risk of readmission; scores of 3 or 4 and above 5 had 30-day readmission rates of 19%, and 29%, respectively. We then applied this risk scoring model to patients enrolled in PACT to determine how many of them would have been identified as high risk for readmission based on the regression model. RESULTS: A total of 393 patients were enrolled in PACT in a year and completed a 5 week intervention. Eighty seven percent had 1 cardiac comorbid illness (76% CAD, 66% CHF, and 17% Afib). Readmission data was available through 2010 thus, the analysis was completed for 111 patients. Ninety-five percent of PACT enrollees had a risk score greater than 3: 19 patients (17.1%) had a risk score of 3-4, and 87 patients (78.4%) had a risk score of 5 or greater. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalization history alone is a reasonable proxy to more formal multivariable regression models in predicting 30-day readmission risk. If substantiated through further study, this could have national implications for real time high risk patient identification for transitional services.

Most existing risk prediction models perform poorly, do not differentiate between avoidable and unavoidable readmissions, or rely on information not commonly available prior to discharge. To help clinicians target transitional care interventions most effectively, we derived and internally validated a prediction model for potentially avoidable 30-day hospital readmissions in medical patients using readily available administrative and clinical data. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included 10,731 admissions to the medical services of Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) during the 2009-2010 academic year. The outcome was an index admission followed by a potentially avoidable 30-day readmission to any service at BWH or to two other hospitals in the Partners Healthcare system, which together account for over 80% of readmissions. Potentially Avoidable Readmissions (PAR) were differentiated from non-avoidable readmissions using a validated computerized algorithm based on administrative data (SQLape) commonly used in Switzerland to benchmark and compare hospitals. Admissions were randomly assigned to derivation (2/3) and validation (1/3) sets. Baseline demographic data, previous health care utilization, co-morbid conditions, and laboratory testing were used as predictors in a logistic regression model with 30-day PAR as the dependent variable. RESULTS: There were 2,398 (22 %) admissions followed by a 30-day readmission, of which 1,101 (10%) were identified as PAR. The prediction score identified 6 independent factors, which we refer to as the PAR ScOrE: any ICD-9 coded Procedure, number of Admissions in the previous 12 months (0, 1 to 5, or &gt;5), Renal failure (glomerular filtration rate of 0-29, 30-59, or&gt;60 ml/min) at the time of discharge, low Sodium level (&lt; 135 mmol/l) at the time of discharge, discharge from an Oncology service, and Elective admission (Table). We then developed a scoring system to stratify risk of potentially avoidable 30- day readmission into 4 categories. With this prediction model, lowrisk patients having 0-1 points (13% of patients) had a 3% risk of PAR, while high-risk patients having &gt;7 points (15% of patients) had a 27% risk of PAR. The PAR ScOrE had a good discriminatory power (C-statistic 0.72 and 0.70) and had good calibration (Hosmer- Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic P=0.67 and P=0.72) in the derivation set and validation set, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This simple prediction model accurately identifies the risk of potentially avoidable 30-day readmission in medical patients. While it still needs external validation, this score has potential to easily identify patients in need of more intensive transitional care interventions to prevent avoidable hospital readmissions.

Hospitals that measure the proportion of urgent readmissions judged avoidable need to know previously published rates for comparison. In this study, we generated a literature-based estimate for the proportion of 30-day urgent readmissions deemed avoidable for hospitals to use to gauge their performance in avoidable readmissions. Methods We searched the Medline and Embase databases to identify published studies that reported the proportion of 30-day urgent readmissions deemed avoidable. We then modelled the overall proportion of 30-day urgent readmissions deemed avoidable. Results We included 16 studies that used a wide variety of patients and a diverse range of methods to classify readmissions as avoidable. Studies reported a broad range for the proportion of urgent 30-day readmissions deemed avoidable. Overall, 848 of 3669 readmissions (23.1%, 95% confidence interval, 21.7-24.5) of 30-day urgent readmissions were classified as avoidable. This proportion varied significantly based on hospital teaching status and number of reviewers for each case [teaching hospitals: with one reviewer, 9.3% (4.2-19.3); with &gt;1 reviewer, 21.6% (13.2-33.3); non-teaching hospital: with one reviewer, 32.2% (11.4-63.9); with &gt;1 reviewer, 39.9% (37.6-42.2)]. Significant heterogeneity remained between studies even after clustering studies by these covariates. Conclusions Less than one in four readmissions were deemed avoidable. Health system planners need to use caution in interpreting all cause readmission statistics as they are only partially influenced by quality of care. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lagoe, Ronald J</author><author>Nanno, Diane S</author><author>Luziani, Mary E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantitative tools for addressing hospital readmissions</title><secondary-title>BMC research notes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC research notes</full-title></periodical><pages>620</pages><volume>5</volume><keywords><keyword>*electronic medical record</keyword><keyword>*health care quality</keyword><keyword>*hospital patient</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>80 and over</keyword><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Electronic Health Records</keyword><keyword>Health Care Costs</keyword><keyword>Hospitalization</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Inpatients</keyword><keyword>Length of Stay</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Patient Discharge</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Quality of Health Care</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>Young Adult</keyword><keyword>adolescent</keyword><keyword>adult</keyword><keyword>aged</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>economics</keyword><keyword>health care cost</keyword><keyword>hospital discharge</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>middle aged</keyword><keyword>standard</keyword><keyword>standards</keyword><keyword>statistics</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>time</keyword><keyword>very elderly</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><pub-location>R.J.

Major payors have already developed financial penalties for providers that generate excess readmissions. This subject has benefitted from the development of resources such as the Potentially Preventable Readmissions software. This process has encouraged hospitals to renew efforts to improve these outcomes. The aim of this study was to describe quantitative tools such as definitions, risk estimation, and tracking of patients for reducing hospital readmissions. FINDINGS: This study employed the Potentially Preventable Readmissions software to develop quantitative tools for addressing hospital readmissions. These tools included two definitions of readmissions that support identification and management of patients. They also included analytical approaches for estimation of the risk of readmission for individual patients by age, discharge status of the initial admission, and severity of illness. They also included patient specific spreadsheets for tracking of target populations and for evaluation of the impact of interventions. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that quantitative tools including the development of definitions of readmissions, estimation of the risk of readmission, and patient specific spreadsheets could contribute to the improvement of patient outcomes in hospitals.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Feigenbaum, Paul</author><author>Neuwirth, Estee</author><author>Trowbridge, Linda</author><author>Teplitsky, Serge</author><author>Barnes, Carol Ann</author><author>Fireman, Emily</author><author>Dorman, Jann</author><author>Bellows, Jim</author><author>P., Feigenbaum</author><author>E., Neuwirth</author><author>L., Trowbridge</author><author>S., Teplitsky</author><author>C.A., Barnes</author><author>E., Fireman</author><author>J., Dorman</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Factors contributing to all-cause 30-day readmissions: A structured case series across 18 hospitals</title><secondary-title>Medical Care</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Medical Care</full-title></periodical><pages>599-605</pages><volume>50</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>80 and over</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Advance Care Planning</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>California</keyword><keyword>Continental Population Groups</keyword><keyword>Continuity of Patient Care</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hospital Administration</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Office Visits</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Quality Improvement</keyword><keyword>Quality of Health Care</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>adult</keyword><keyword>aged</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>caregiver</keyword><keyword>clinical assessment</keyword><keyword>community hospital</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>follow up</keyword><keyword>health care system</keyword><keyword>hospital discharge</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>interview</keyword><keyword>major clinical study</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>medical record review</keyword><keyword>organization &amp; administration</keyword><keyword>patient care</keyword><keyword>physician</keyword><keyword>priority journal</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>team nursing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><pub-location>E.

Research Design: Structured case series of 537 readmissions using chart reviews, interviews with treating physicians, patients and family caregivers, and overall case assessment by a nurse-physician team. Setting: Eighteen Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospitals. Results: Forty-seven percent (250) of readmissions were assessed as potentially preventable; 11% (55) were assessed as very or completely preventable; and 36% (195) as slightly or moderately preventable. On average, 8.7 factors contributed to each potentially preventable readmission. Factors were related to care during the index stay (in 143 cases, 57% of potentially preventable readmissions), the discharge process (168, 67%), and follow-up care (197, 79%). Missed opportunities to prevent readmissions were also related to quality improvement focus areas: transitions care planning and care coordination, clinical care, logistics of follow-up care, advance care planning and end-of-life care, and medication management. Conclusions: Multiple factors contributed to potentially preventable readmissions in an integrated health care system with low baseline readmission rates. Reducing all-cause 30-day readmissions may require a comprehensive approach addressing these areas. Future quality improvement efforts and research should identify existing and new tactics that can best prevent readmissions by addressing missed opportunities we identified. © 2012 by Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>P, Mehla</author><author>A, Iskandar</author><author>R, Andrews</author><author>M, Barry</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chart review to determine which heart failure readmissions are preventable</title><secondary-title>Journal of Cardiac Failure</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Cardiac Failure</full-title></periodical><pages>S107-S107</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>8 SUPPL. 1</issue><keywords><keyword>*Western Hemisphere</keyword><keyword>*heart failure</keyword><keyword>*medical record review</keyword><keyword>*society</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>cardiologist</keyword><keyword>data base</keyword><keyword>health center</keyword><keyword>hospital</keyword><keyword>hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>internist</keyword><keyword>monitoring</keyword><keyword>outpatient</keyword><keyword>patient</keyword><keyword>population</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><pub-location>P.

We reviewed the charts of readmitted patients in the year prior to our initiative to determine if we could identify which readmissions were preventable. Methods: We used the Connecticut Hospital Association's Chimedata database to determine the 30-day all-cause readmission rate in the year before (2008) and the year after (2011) our initiative. For unplanned readmissions to our own institution in 2008, three providers (cardiologist, internist, heart failure APRN) reviewed the clinical charts from hospitalization, rehospitalization, and any outpatient visits within our own system. Each reviewer determined whether the readmission was preventable, not preventable, or indeterminate based on their experience. Results: Our 30-day all-cause readmission rate fell from 27.1% in 2008 to 19.1% in 2011 (p &lt; 0.01), a decrease of 30%. In 2008, 40 HF patients had an unplanned readmission to our own hospital. Of these, providers identified 20 to 30% as preventable although reviewers disagreed over which readmissions were avoidable (Figures 1 &amp; 2). All 3 chart reviewers considered over half of readmissions not preventable. The most commonly cited intervention that could have avoided a readmission was closer monitoring in the outpatient setting. Conclusion: Retrospective chart review identified avoidable readmissions at a frequency close to the readmission reduction achieved by our HF program. This suggests subjective chart review by providers may be able to predict the success of a HF readmission reduction program.

Readmissions contribute to increased costs which may not be reimbursed. Several non-modifiable risk factors have been identified, but predictors of readmission based on discharge criteria have not been studied. Current goals were to determine our readmission rate, predictors of readmission, and identify preventable readmissions. Methods: A retrospective review of subjects undergoing major bowel resections over a 2-year period were identified through a database. Patient charts were reviewed and the following collected: hemodynamics, oral intake, IV narcotic and anti-emetic use 24 hours prior to discharge, time to readmission and diagnosis. Two senior authors (ML and TA) audited all readmissions and determined necessity and preventability. Univariate and multivariate analysis was carried out to determine factors associated with readmission. Results: Readmission rates for 845 major bowel resections in the 30 days following discharge was 19.9% (4.1% seen in the ED and released, 15.7% hospitalized). Common causes of readmission were: deep SSI/abscess/leak (24.4%), abdominal pain NOS (20.8%), and ileus/small bowel obstruction (16.7%). Predictors of readmission on univariate analysis (P&lt;0.05) were: emergent admission, open surgery, total colectomy, ileostomy, hospital stay &gt;5d, and disposition to a care facility. Multivariate analysis showed open surgery and a new ileostomy associated with a 1.5- and 1.8-times greater risk of readmission. Hemodynamic derangements, administration of IV narcotics or antiemetics, and poor oral intake 12-24 hours prior to discharge were not associated with readmission. Only 11% of readmissions were deemed preventable and were related to ileostomy care or discharge medications. Conclusions: Risk factors for readmission are open surgery, total abdominal colectomy, new ileostomy, emergent index admission, disposition to a care facility and prolonged hospital stay. In the 24h prior to discharge, there are few clues regarding oral intake, hemodynamic changes or need for IV medication that predict readmission. Finally, only a small proportion of readmissions can be prevented.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>R.S, Walters</author><author>L.M, Kidin</author><author>J, Roquemore</author><author>V.S, Jordan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Thirty-day all-cause readmission rate at a cancer center as a quality of care measure</title><secondary-title>Journal of Clinical Oncology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Clinical Oncology</full-title></periodical><pages>no pagination-no pagination</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>34 SUPPL. 1</issue><keywords><keyword>*cancer center</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*human</keyword><keyword>chemotherapy</keyword><keyword>classification</keyword><keyword>data base</keyword><keyword>dehydration</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>emergency care</keyword><keyword>febrile neutropenia</keyword><keyword>health</keyword><keyword>hospital</keyword><keyword>immunotherapy</keyword><keyword>leukemia</keyword><keyword>lymphoma</keyword><keyword>methodology</keyword><keyword>neoplasm</keyword><keyword>oncology</keyword><keyword>patient</keyword><keyword>physician</keyword><keyword>pneumonia</keyword><keyword>population</keyword><keyword>postoperative infection</keyword><keyword>sepsis</keyword><keyword>stem cell</keyword><keyword>stratification</keyword><keyword>university</keyword><keyword>urinary tract infection</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><pub-location>R.S.

Readmissions are assumed to reflect failure by the discharging physician, hospital, or post acute care. These rates are generally easily calculated from available administrative data, and classifiable as &quot;related to the previous discharge diagnosis&quot; or not. Present on admission modifiers may enhance classification and assignment to &quot;preventable&quot; or &quot;non-preventable,&quot; &quot;expected or non-expected.&quot; This methodology is not generally applicable to the oncology population. The experience with one major cancer center is presented as an example of the limitations of such an approach. Methods: We analyzed 52,097 oncology admissions in an all-payer population that occurred between January 2010 and January 2012. Results: A mean of 32.5% (n=16,918) were readmitted within 30 days, compared to a &quot;peer&quot; group in the database of the University Health Consortium, median of 15%. The attached graph demonstrates the stability of this proportion. Leukemia, lymphoma, stem cell patients (46%), all patients with intense medical needs and frequent readmissions, n=7,635, were the largest subgroup. 42% (n=7,099) were readmissions for chemotherapy or immunotherapy, both planned and expected, and 11% (n=1,803) due to neutropenic fever, pneumonia, or sepsis, all common in this population and neither unexpected nor usually preventable. The most preventable, unexpected, and unplanned readmissions were for postoperative infection, dehydration, and urinary tract infection, accounting for 3.6% (n=609). Thus, the majority of readmissions were planned, expected, or not preventable. Conclusions: In a cancer population at an academic cancer hospital, the majority of readmission are not only planned, but also expected for this population of patients and should not be construed as representative of a quality of care issue. Proper stratification and classification of readmissions is essential to the interpretation of such a measure.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>G.D., Sacks</author><author>A.J., Dawes</author><author>M.M., Russell</author><author>A.Y., Lin</author><author>M.M., Gibbons</author><author>A., Tillou</author><author>J.S.T., Linson</author><author>D.T., Hiyama</author><author>J.R., Hiatt</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>All-cause surgical readmissions: Does administrative data tell the real story?</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American College of Surgeons</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American College of Surgeons</full-title></periodical><pages>S97-S97</pages><volume>215</volume><issue>3 SUPPL. 1</issue><keywords><keyword>*college</keyword><keyword>*human</keyword><keyword>*surgeon</keyword><keyword>aorta valve replacement</keyword><keyword>clinical study</keyword><keyword>colon resection</keyword><keyword>convenience sample</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>documentation</keyword><keyword>general surgery</keyword><keyword>hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>lobectomy</keyword><keyword>medical record</keyword><keyword>medical record review</keyword><keyword>patient</keyword><keyword>physician</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year></dates><pub-location>G.D.

Our study aim was two-Fold: (1) to apply the proposed readmission measure to a selected cohort of surgical readmissions; (2) to determine accuracy of administrative codes at determining cause for readmission. METHODS: Patients discharged from general surgery services over eight consecutive quarters (Q4 2009-Q3 2011) were selected. 30-day readmissions were identified and physician review of the medical record was performed. Readmission reason was determined using clinical data. Planned readmissions based on the CMS measure were identified. RESULTS: Analysis of a convenience sample of 128 surgical readmissions identified only 4 planned readmissions (3%) for scheduled surgery (2 colon resections, 1 thoracic lobectomy, 1 aortic valve replacement), and thus 97% were considered unplanned by the CMS measure. Of the remaining 124 readmissions, 18% were excluded based on reason for readmission as determined from the clinical data (Table). Comparing administrative data to clinical medical record documentation, one third of readmissions were coded incorrectly. Reasons for coding discrepancy were: coding of a secondary diagnosis code (40%), coding a chronic rather than acute medical condition (30%), and inaccurate code (30%). (Table presented) CONCLUSIONS: Using the CMS readmission measure identifies 97% of surgical readmissions as unplanned. In contrast, medical record review identifies only 57% of readmissions with an acute problem related to the index admission. Given the large discrepancy between administrative and clinical data in determining unplanned readmissions, further work is needed to better classify surgical readmissions before endorsing an all-cause readmission measure.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Donze, Jacques</author><author>Lipsitz, Stuart</author><author>Bates, David W</author><author>Schnipper, Jeffrey L</author><author>J., Donze</author><author>S., Lipsitz Prof.</author><author>W., David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Causes and patterns of readmissions in patients with common comorbidities: Retrospective cohort study</title><secondary-title>BMJ (Online)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMJ (Online)</full-title></periodical><pages>no pagination</pages><volume>347</volume><keywords><keyword>*comorbidity</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>Academic Medical Centers</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Age Distribution</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Boston</keyword><keyword>Cohort Studies</keyword><keyword>Comorbidity</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Incidence</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Patient Discharge</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Sex Distribution</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>adult</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>chronic kidney disease</keyword><keyword>chronic obstructive lung disease</keyword><keyword>cohort analysis</keyword><keyword>congestive heart failure</keyword><keyword>diabetes mellitus</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>gastrointestinal disease</keyword><keyword>heart atrium fibrillation</keyword><keyword>heart atrium flutter</keyword><keyword>high risk patient</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>ischemic heart disease</keyword><keyword>kidney failure</keyword><keyword>liver disease</keyword><keyword>major clinical study</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>neoplasm</keyword><keyword>pneumonia</keyword><keyword>priority journal</keyword><keyword>respiratory tract infection</keyword><keyword>retrospective study</keyword><keyword>risk factor</keyword><keyword>septicemia</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>urinary tract infection</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><pub-location>J.

Design Retrospective cohort study. Setting Academic tertiary medical centre in Boston, 2009-10. Participants 10 731 consecutive adult discharges from a medical department. Main outcome measures Primary readmission diagnoses of readmissions within 30 days of discharge and potentially avoidable 30 day readmissions to the index hospital or two other hospitals in its network. Results Among 10 731 discharges, 2398 (22.3%) were followed by a 30 day readmission, of which 858 (8.0%) were identified as potentially avoidable. Overall, infection, neoplasm, heart failure, gastrointestinal disorder, and liver disorder were the most frequent primary diagnoses of potentially avoidable readmissions. Almost all of the top five diagnoses of potentially avoidable readmissions for each comorbidity were possible direct or indirect complications of that comorbidity. In patients with a comorbidity of heart failure, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, or chronic kidney disease, the most common diagnosis of potentially avoidable readmission was acute heart failure. Patients with neoplasm, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease had a higher risk of potentially avoidable readmissions than did those without those comorbidities. Conclusions The five most common primary diagnoses of potentially avoidable readmissions were usually possible complications of an underlying comorbidity. Post-discharge care should focus attention not just on the primary index admission diagnosis but also on the comorbidities patients have.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Walraven, Carl</author><author>Forster, Alan J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>When projecting required effectiveness of interventions for hospital readmission reduction, the percentage that is potentially avoidable must be considered</title><secondary-title>Journal of Clinical Epidemiology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Clinical Epidemiology</full-title></periodical><pages>688-690</pages><volume>66</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Data Interpretation</keyword><keyword>Health Care</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Models</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Quality Indicators</keyword><keyword>Statistical</keyword><keyword>Theoretical</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><pub-location>C.

Not all hospital readmissions are potentially avoidable. Therefore, only a component of all hospital readmissions can be influenced by interventions designed to decrease them. In this study, we determined how effective interventions must be to attain specific reductions in hospital readmission rates. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A conceptual model of all readmissions and potentially avoidable readmissions was used to derive a mathematical relationship between the relative reduction in the total number of readmissions, the relative reduction in potentially avoidable readmissions, and the proportion of readmissions that are potentially avoidable. RESULTS: When 22% of readmissions were potentially avoidable, achieving a 20% reduction in the total number of readmissions required a 91% reduction in potentially avoidable readmissions; decreasing potentially avoidable readmissions by 20% reduced total readmissions by 4.4%. CONCLUSION: These results highlight that relative reductions in the total number of readmissions are notably lower than that for potentially avoidable readmissions. This separation in relative reduction of all and potentially avoidable readmissions increases as the proportion of readmissions deemed potentially avoidable decreases. These results have important implications for health care planners and researchers.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mull, Hillary J</author><author>Chen, Qi</author><author>O'Brien, William J</author><author>Shwartz, Michael</author><author>Borzecki, Ann M</author><author>Hanchate, Amresh</author><author>Rosen, Amy K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparing 2 methods of assessing 30-day readmissions: What is the impact on hospital profiling in the veterans health administration?</title><secondary-title>Medical Care</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Medical Care</full-title></periodical><pages>589-596</pages><volume>51</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (U.S.)</keyword><keyword>Health</keyword><keyword>Health Care</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Insurance</keyword><keyword>Mandatory Reporting</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Myocardial Infarction</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Pneumonia</keyword><keyword>Quality Assurance</keyword><keyword>Reimbursement</keyword><keyword>Risk Adjustment</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>United States Department of Veterans Affairs</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><pub-location>Q.

These 2 methods have not been directly compared in terms of how they identify high-performing and low-performing hospitals. OBJECTIVES: To examine how consistently the CMS and PPR methods identify performance outliers, and explore how the PPR preventability component impacts hospital readmission rates, public reporting on CMS' Hospital Compare website, and pay-for-performance under CMS' Hospital Readmission Reduction Program for 3 conditions (acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia). METHODS: We applied the CMS all-cause model and the PPR software to VA administrative data to calculate 30-day observed FY08-10 VA hospital readmission rates and hospital profiles. We then tested the effect of preventability on hospital readmission rates and outlier identification for reporting and pay-for-performance by replacing the dependent variable in the CMS all-cause model (Yes/No readmission) with the dichotomous PPR outcome (Yes/No preventable readmission). RESULTS: The CMS and PPR methods had moderate correlations in readmission rates for each condition. After controlling for all methodological differences but preventability, correlations increased to &gt;90%. The assessment of preventability yielded different outlier results for public reporting in 7% of hospitals; for 30% of hospitals there would be an impact on Hospital Readmission Reduction Program reimbursement rates. CONCLUSIONS: Despite uncertainty over which readmission measure is superior in evaluating hospital performance, we confirmed that there are differences in CMS-generated and PPR-generated hospital profiles for reporting and pay-for-performance, because of methodological differences and the PPR's preventability component.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Donzé, Jacques</author><author>Aujesky, Drahomir</author><author>Williams, Deborah</author><author>Schnipper, Jeffrey L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Potentially avoidable 30-day hospital readmissions in medical patients: derivation and validation of a prediction model.</title><secondary-title>JAMA internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JAMA internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>632-638</pages><volume>173</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>80 and over</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Algorithms</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Logistic Models</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Models</keyword><keyword>Patient Discharge</keyword><keyword>Patient Discharge: statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission: statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Theoretical</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><accession-num>23529115</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1001/jamainternmed.2013.3023</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23529115</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>IMPORTANCE: Because effective interventions to reduce hospital readmissions are often expensive to implement, a score to predict potentially avoidable readmissions may help target the patients most likely to benefit.\n\nOBJECTIVE: To derive and internally validate a prediction model for potentially avoidable 30-day hospital readmissions in medical patients using administrative and clinical data readily available prior to discharge.\n\nDESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.\n\nSETTING: Academic medical center in Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nPARTICIPANTS: All patient discharges from any medical services between July 1, 2009, and June 30, 2010.\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Potentially avoidable 30-day readmissions to 3 hospitals of the Partners HealthCare network were identified using a validated computerized algorithm based on administrative data (SQLape).

The proportion of poststroke readmissions that is potentially preventable is unknown. METHODS - Thirty-day readmissions for all Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged &gt;65 years discharged alive with a primary diagnosis of ischemic stroke (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification 433, 434, 436) between December 2005 and November 2006 were analyzed. Preventable readmissions were identified based on 14 Prevention Quality Indicators developed for use with administrative data by the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. National, hospital-level, and regional preventable readmission rates were estimated. Random-effects logistic regression was also used to determine patient-level factors associated with preventable readmissions. RESULTS - Among 307 887 ischemic stroke discharges, 44 379 (14.4%) were readmitted within 30 days; 5322 (1.7% of all discharges) were the result of a preventable cause (eg, pneumonia), and 39 057 (12.7%) were for other reasons (eg, cancer). In multivariate analysis, older age and cardiovascular-related comorbid conditions were strong predictors of preventable readmissions. Preventable readmission rates were highest in the Southeast, Mid-Atlantic, and US territories and lowest in the Mountain and Pacific regions. CONCLUSIONS - On the basis of Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Prevention Quality Indicators, we found that a small proportion of readmissions after ischemic stroke were classified as preventable. Although other causes of readmissions not reflected in the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality measures could also be avoidable, hospital-level programs intended to reduce all-cause readmissions and costs should target high-risk patients. © 2013 American Heart Association, Inc.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hechenbleikner, Elizabeth M</author><author>Makary, Martin A</author><author>Samarov, Daniel V</author><author>Bennett, Jennifer L</author><author>Gearhart, Susan L</author><author>Efron, Jonathan E</author><author>Wick, Elizabeth C</author><author>E.M., Hechenbleikner</author><author>M.A., Makary</author><author>D.V., Samarov</author><author>J.L., Bennett</author><author>S.L., Gearhart</author><author>J.E., Efron</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hospital readmission by method of data collection.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American College of Surgeons</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American College of Surgeons</full-title></periodical><pages>1150-1158</pages><volume>216</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>*data collection method</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>80 and over</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Colectomy</keyword><keyword>Colorectal Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Data Collection</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Health Care</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Medical Records</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Quality Indicators</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Young Adult</keyword><keyword>adult</keyword><keyword>aged</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>colorectal cancer/su [Surgery]</keyword><keyword>colorectal surgery</keyword><keyword>dehydration/co [Complication]</keyword><keyword>diverticulitis/su [Surgery]</keyword><keyword>enteritis/su [Surgery]</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>major clinical study</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>medical record review</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>patient care</keyword><keyword>priority journal</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>surgical infection/co [Complication]</keyword><keyword>surgical patient</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><pub-location>E.C.

We hypothesized that readmission rates, readmissions related to index admission, and potentially unnecessary readmissions vary by data collection method for surgical patients. STUDY DESIGN: Using 3 different data collection methods, we compared 30-day unplanned readmission rates and potentially unnecessary readmissions among colorectal surgery patients at a single institution between July 2009 and November 2011. We compared the NSQIP clinical reviewer method, the University HealthSystem Consortium (UHC) administrative billing data method, and physician medical record review. RESULTS: Seven hundred and thirty-five colorectal surgery patients were identified with readmission rates as follows: NSQIP 14.6% (107 of 735) vs UHC 17.6% (129 of 735). The NSQIP method identified 9 readmissions not found in billing records because the readmission occurred at another hospital (n = 7) or due to a discrepancy in definition (n = 2). The UHC method identified 31 readmissions not identified by NSQIP because of a broader readmission definition (n = 20) or were missed by reviewers (n = 11). The NSQIP method identified 72% of readmissions as related to index admission and physician chart review identified 83%. The UHC method identified 51% of readmissions as related to index admission and physician chart review identified 86%. Sixty-six of 129 UHC readmissions (51%) were deemed potentially preventable; based on physician chart review, 112 of 129 readmissions (87%) were deemed clinically necessary at the time of presentation. Most readmissions were due to surgical site infections (46 of 129 [36%]) and dehydration (30 of 129 [23%]). With improved patient-care efforts, 41 of 129 (31.8%) complications might not have required readmission. CONCLUSIONS: Readmission rates and unnecessary readmissions vary depending on data collection methodology. Reimbursements based on readmission should use standardized and fair methods to minimize perverse incentives that penalize hospitals for appropriate care of high-risk surgical patients.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McCormack, Richard</author><author>Michels, Ryan</author><author>Ramos, Nicholas</author><author>Hutzler, Lorraine</author><author>Slover, James D</author><author>Bosco, Joseph A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Thirty-day readmission rates as a measure of quality: causes of readmission after orthopedic surgeries and accuracy of administrative data.</title><secondary-title>Journal of Healthcare Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Healthcare Management</full-title></periodical><pages>64-76</pages><volume>58</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Databases</keyword><keyword>Factual</keyword><keyword>Health Care</keyword><keyword>Hospitals</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Medical Records</keyword><keyword>New York</keyword><keyword>Orthopedics</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Postoperative Complications</keyword><keyword>Quality Indicators</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>University</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>standards</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><isbn>1096-9012</isbn><accession-num>23424819</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=emed11&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=2014147813</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The rate of unplanned 30-day readmissions to the hospital after discharge is being used as a marker to compare the quality of care across hospitals and to set reimbursement levels for care. While the readmission rate can be reported using administrative data, the accuracy of these data is variable, and defining which readmissions are unplanned and preventable is often difficult. The purpose of this study was to review readmissions to a single orthopedic hospital to identify the causes for readmission and, in particular, which readmissions are planned versus unplanned. Using that hospital's administrative database of patient records from 2007 to 2009, we identified all patients who were readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of a previous hospitalization for a procedure. Readmissions were broadly categorized as planned (a staged or rescheduled procedure or a direct transfer) or unplanned. Unplanned readmissions were defined as either surgical or nonsurgical complications (medical conditions not directly related to the procedure). Almost 30 percent of readmissions were planned. Of the unplanned readmissions, close to 60 percent were triggered by an infection or a concern for an infection. Nonsurgical complications accounted for 18.2 percent of unplanned readmissions. This study highlights the importance of careful data collection and abstraction when calculating early readmission rates. Preventing surgical site infection and better coordinating care between orthopedic surgeons and primary care and medical subspecialty physicians may significantly reduce readmission rates.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J, Donze</author><author>D, Aujesky</author><author>D, Williams</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Potentially avoidable 30-day hospital readmissions in medical patients: Derivation and validation of a prediction model</title><secondary-title>JAMA Internal Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JAMA Internal Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>632-638</pages><volume>173</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>*health care policy</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>comorbidity</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>hemoglobin/ec [Endogenous Compound]</keyword><keyword>hospital admission</keyword><keyword>hospital discharge</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>major clinical study</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>medical service</keyword><keyword>patient care</keyword><keyword>priority journal</keyword><keyword>retrospective study</keyword><keyword>scoring system</keyword><keyword>sodium/ec [Endogenous Compound]</keyword><keyword>validation study</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><pub-location>J.

In 2009/10 there were 276 386 adult hospital readmissions in England. Readmissions increase cost to the healthcare system and are preventable. Method: A retrospective study of all surgical readmissions over a period of 12 weeks to two District General Hospitals in the UK was done. Results: One hundred and ninety-seven case records were reviewed. The majority of readmissions were related to the index pathology (74.5%). Post-op wound collection (10.6%), cholelithiasis (10.1%), nonspecific abdominal pain (7.6%), and post-operative pain (6.6%) were the main causes for readmissions. Sixty percent of patients were women. 80.9% of all patients readmitted with wound collections required drainage procedures. Non-surgical pathologies were coded as surgical admissions (10.8%). The overall cost of readmissions was 395 495, with a projected annual cost of 1.7 million. Twenty-seven (13.7%) readmissions reviewed were not releveant with index procedure and therefore avoidable (projected annual saving 182 593). Coding errors were responsible for 11.2% of all readmissions which were incorrectly classed under the surgical directorate. Conclusion: The bulk of surgical readmissions are a consequence of operative activity and/or chronic pathology. Combining all avoidable cases and those incorrectly coded, 462 634 could be saved.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dawes, Aaron J</author><author>Sacks, Greg D</author><author>Russell, Marcia M</author><author>Lin, Anne Y</author><author>Maggard-Gibbons, Melinda</author><author>Winograd, Deborah</author><author>Chung, Hallie R</author><author>Tillou, Areti</author><author>Hiatt, Jonathan R</author><author>Ko, Clifford</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Preventable readmissions to surgical services: lessons learned and targets for improvement.</title><secondary-title>Journal of the American College of Surgeons</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the American College of Surgeons</full-title></periodical><pages>382-389</pages><volume>219</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hospital</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Postoperative Complications</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Surgery Department, Hospital</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>prevention &amp; control</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>24891209</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2014.03.046</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>BACKGROUND: Hospital readmissions are under intense scrutiny as a measure of health care quality. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has proposed using readmission rates as a benchmark for improving care, including targeting them as nonreimbursable events. Our study aim was to describe potentially preventable readmissions after surgery and to identify targets for improvement. STUDY DESIGN: Patients discharged from a general surgery service over 8 consecutive quarters (Q4 2009 to Q3 2011) were selected. A working group of attending surgeons defined terms and created classification schemes. Thirty-day readmissions were identified and reviewed by a 2-physician team. Readmissions were categorized as preventable or unpreventable, and by target for future quality improvement intervention. RESULTS: Overall readmission rate was 8.3% (315 of 3,789). The most common indication for initial admission was elective general surgery. Among readmitted patients in our sample, 28% did not undergo an operation during their index admission. Only 21% (55 of 258) of readmissions were likely preventable based on medical record review. Of the preventable readmissions, 38% of patients were discharged within 24 hours and 60% within 48 hours. Dehydration occurred more frequently among preventable readmissions (p &lt; 0.001). Infection accounted for more than one-third of all readmissions. Among preventable readmissions, targets for improvement included closer follow-up after discharge (49%), management in the outpatient setting (42%), and avoidance of premature discharge (9%). CONCLUSIONS: A minority of readmissions may potentially be preventable. Targets for reducing readmissions include addressing the clinical issues of infection and dehydration as well as improving discharge planning to limit both early and short readmissions. Policies aimed at penalizing reimbursements based on readmission rates should use clinical data to focus on inappropriate hospitalization in order to promote high quality patient care.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sacks, Greg D</author><author>Dawes, Aaron J</author><author>Russell, Marcia M</author><author>Lin, Anne Y</author><author>Maggard-Gibbons, Melinda</author><author>Winograd, Deborah</author><author>Chung, Hallie R</author><author>Tomlinson, James</author><author>Tillou, Areti</author><author>Shew, Stephen B</author><author>Hiyama, Darryl T</author><author>Cryer, H Gill</author><author>Brunicardi, F Charles</author><author>Hiatt, Jonathan R</author><author>Ko, Clifford</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of hospital readmissions in surgical patients do administrative data tell the real story?</title><secondary-title>JAMA Surgery</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JAMA Surgery</full-title></periodical><pages>759-764</pages><volume>149</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>80 and over</keyword><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Health Care</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>International Classification of Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Medical Records</keyword><keyword>Medicare</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Operative</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Quality Indicators</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Surgical Procedures</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>Young Adult</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>standards</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical  data</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><pub-location>G.D.

OBJECTIVES: To examine the accuracy of administrative codes in determining the cause of readmission as determined by medical record review, to evaluate the readmission measure's ability to accurately identify a readmission as planned, and to document the frequency of readmissions for reasons clinically unrelated to the original hospital stay. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective review of all consecutive patients discharged from general surgery services at a tertiary care, university-affiliated teaching hospital during 8 consecutive quarters (quarter 4 [October through December] of 2009 through quarter 3 [July through September] of 2011). Clinical readmission diagnosis determined from direct medical record review was compared with the administrative diagnosis recorded in a claims database. The number of planned hospital readmissions defined by the readmission measure was compared with the number identified using clinical data. Readmissions unrelated to the original hospital stay were identified using clinical data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Discordance rate between administrative and clinical diagnoses for all hospital readmissions, discrepancy between planned readmissions defined by the readmission measure and identified by clinical medical record review, and fraction of hospital readmissions unrelated to the original hospital stay. RESULTS: Of the 315 hospital readmissions, the readmission diagnosis listed in the administrative claims data differed from the clinical diagnosis in 97 readmissions (30.8%). The readmission measure identified 15 readmissions (4.8%) as planned, whereas clinical data identified 43 readmissions (13.7%) as planned. Unrelated readmissions comprised 70 of the 258 unplanned readmissions (27.1%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Administrative billing data, as used by the readmission measure, do not reliably describe the reason for readmission. The readmission measure accounts for less than half of the planned readmissions and does not account for the nearly one-third of readmissions unrelated to the original hospital stay. Implementation of this readmission measure may result in unwarranted financial penalties for hospitals.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Horwitz, Leora I</author><author>Partovian, Chohreh</author><author>Lin, Zhenqiu</author><author>Grady, Jacqueline N</author><author>Herrin, Jeph</author><author>Conover, Mitchell</author><author>Montague, Julia</author><author>Dillaway, Chloe</author><author>Bartczak, Kathleen</author><author>Suter, Lisa G</author><author>Ross, Joseph S</author><author>Bernheim, Susannah M</author><author>Krumholz, Harlan M</author><author>Drye, Elizabeth E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Development and use of an administrative claims measure for profiling hospital-wide performance on 30-day unplanned readmission</title><secondary-title>Annals of internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>S66-S75</pages><volume>161</volume><issue>10 Supplement</issue><keywords><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*insurance</keyword><keyword>*risk standardized readmission rate</keyword><keyword>*standards</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Fee-for-Service Plans</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hospital Mortality</keyword><keyword>Hospitals</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Insurance Claim Review</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Medicare</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Quality Improvement</keyword><keyword>Risk Adjustment</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>aged</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>clinical classification</keyword><keyword>comorbidity</keyword><keyword>emergency care</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>hospital</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>major clinical study</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>medical fee</keyword><keyword>medicare</keyword><keyword>mortality</keyword><keyword>prospective payment</keyword><keyword>risk assessment</keyword><keyword>standards</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>statistics and numerical data</keyword><keyword>total quality management</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><pub-location>L.I.

An all-condition measure may better measure quality and promote innovation., OBJECTIVE: To develop an all-condition, hospital-wide readmission measure., DESIGN: Measure development study., SETTING: 4821 U.S. hospitals., PATIENTS: Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 65 years or older., MEASUREMENTS: Hospital-level, risk-standardized unplanned readmissions within 30 days of discharge. The measure uses Medicare fee-for-service claims and is a composite of 5 specialty-based, risk-standardized rates for medicine, surgery/gynecology, cardiorespiratory, cardiovascular, and neurology cohorts. The 2007-2008 admissions were randomly split for development and validation. Models were adjusted for age, principal diagnosis, and comorbid conditions. Calibration in Medicare and all-payer data was examined, and hospital rankings in the development and validation samples were compared., RESULTS: The development data set contained 8 018 949 admissions associated with 1 276 165 unplanned readmissions (15.9%). The median hospital risk-standardized unplanned readmission rate was 15.8 (range, 11.6 to 21.9). The 5 specialty cohort models accurately predicted readmission risk in both Medicare and all-payer data sets for average-risk patients but slightly overestimated readmission risk at the extremes. Overall hospital risk-standardized readmission rates did not differ statistically in the split samples (P = 0.71 for difference in rank), and 76% of hospitals' validation-set rankings were within 2 deciles of the development rank (24% were more than 2 deciles). Of hospitals ranking in the top or bottom deciles, 90% remained within 2 deciles (10% were more than 2 deciles) and 82% remained within 1 decile (18% were more than 1 decile)., LIMITATION: Risk adjustment was limited to that available in claims data., CONCLUSION: A claims-based, hospital-wide unplanned readmission measure for profiling hospitals produced reasonably consistent results in different data sets and was similarly calibrated in both Medicare and all-payer data., PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shimizu, Eri</author><author>Glaspy, Kathleen</author><author>Witt, Mallory D</author><author>Poon, Kimble</author><author>Black, Susan</author><author>Schwartz, Shelley</author><author>Bholat, Tasneem</author><author>Diaz, Norma</author><author>Kuo, Allen</author><author>Spellberg, Brad</author><author>E., Shimizu</author><author>K., Glaspy</author><author>M.D., Witt</author><author>K., Poon</author><author>S., Black</author><author>S., Schwartz</author><author>T., Bholat</author><author>N., Diaz</author><author>A., Kuo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Readmissions at a public safety net hospital</title><secondary-title>PLoS ONE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLoS ONE</full-title></periodical><pages>no pagination</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*safety</keyword><keyword>80 and over</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Comorbidity</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Health</keyword><keyword>Health Care Surveys</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Insurance</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Prospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Safety-net Providers</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>adult</keyword><keyword>aged</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>cohort analysis</keyword><keyword>controlled study</keyword><keyword>disease course</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>health care access</keyword><keyword>health care system</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>internal medicine</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>medical record</keyword><keyword>observational study</keyword><keyword>prospective study</keyword><keyword>reimbursement</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>very elderly</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><publisher>Public Library of Science</publisher><accession-num>24618829</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1371/journal.pone.0091244</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.plosone.org/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0091244&amp;representation=PDF</url><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=emed12&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=2014239609</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Objective: We aimed to determine factors related to avoidability of 30-day readmissions at our public, safety net hospital in the United States (US). Methods: We prospectively reviewed medical records of adult internal medicine patients with scheduled and unscheduled 30-day readmissions. We also interviewed patients if they were available. An independent panel used pre-specified, objective criteria to adjudicate potential avoidability. Results: Of 153 readmissions evaluated, 68% were unscheduled. Among these, 67% were unavoidable, primarily due to disease progression and development of new diagnoses. Scheduled readmissions accounted for 32% of readmissions and most (69%) were clinically appropriate and unavoidable. The scheduled but avoidable readmissions (31%) were attributed largely to limited resources in our healthcare system. Conclusions: Most readmissions at our public, safety net hospital were unavoidable, even among our unscheduled readmissions. Surprisingly, one-third of our overall readmissions were scheduled, the majority reflecting appropriate management strategies designed to reduce unnecessary hospital days. The scheduled but avoidable readmissions were due to constrained access to non-emergent, expensive procedures that are typically not reimbursed given our system's payor mix, a problem which likely plague other safety net systems. These findings suggest that readmissions do not necessarily reflect inadequate medical care, may reflect resource constraints that are unlikely to be addressable in systems caring for a large burden of uninsured patients, and merit individualized review. © 2014 Shimizu et al.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lucas, Donald J</author><author>Pawlik, Timothy M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Readmission after surgery.</title><secondary-title>Advances in surgery</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Advances in surgery</full-title></periodical><pages>185-199</pages><volume>48</volume><keywords><keyword>Comorbidity</keyword><keyword>Health Policy</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Length of Stay</keyword><keyword>Medicare</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Postoperative Complications</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>economics</keyword><keyword>legislation &amp; jurisprudence</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>25293615</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.yasu.2014.05.009</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Readmission is a large problem after both medical and surgical admissions. Recent policy changes that include substantial financial penalties have made readmission an important, if not the most important, pay-for-performance program for health care in the United States. The CMS Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program currently applies only to patients with certain medical diagnoses, but it is expanding into orthopedic surgery in 2014, and will likely involve more surgical procedures in the future. Accordingly, hospitals and researchers will increasingly be focused on understanding and preventing readmission. Definitions of readmission must be standardized between organizations to allow for comparison. The accepted definition for any organization tracking rehospitalization should be 30-day all-cause readmission. In addition, any hospital profiling applications or studies comparing readmission rates between hospitals should use hierarchical rather than standard logistic regression modeling. Rather than relying on findings from medical patients, further studies on the specific causes of readmission after surgery should be conducted. Predictive modeling has some utility in focusing readmission prevention efforts on high-risk patients, but understanding the underlying causes of readmission is key to designing effective prevention interventions. Current evidence suggests that postoperative complications play a key role in surgical readmission, but efforts on improving discharge planning and coordination of care developed in medical patients will also be critical in decreasing unnecessary readmissions in the future.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lavenberg, Julia G</author><author>Leas, Brian</author><author>Umscheid, Craig A</author><author>Williams, Kendal</author><author>Goldmann, David R</author><author>Kripalani, Sunil</author><author>J.G., Lavenberg</author><author>B., Leas</author><author>C.A., Umscheid</author><author>K., Williams</author><author>D.R., Goldmann</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessing preventability in the quest to reduce hospital readmissions</title><secondary-title>Journal of hospital medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of hospital medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>598-603</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>*government</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*procedures</keyword><keyword>Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (U.S.)</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Outcome Assessment (Health Care)</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>outcome assessment</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><accession-num>24961204</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jhm.2226</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=emed13&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=24961204</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Hospitals devote significant human and capital resources to eliminate hospital readmissions, prompted most recently by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) financial penalties for higher-than-expected readmission rates. Implicit in these efforts are assumptions that a significant proportion of readmissions are preventable, and preventable readmissions can be identified. Yet, no consensus exists in the literature regarding methods to determine which readmissions are reasonably preventable. In this article, we examine strengths and limitations of the CMS readmission metric, explore how preventable readmissions have been defined and measured, and discuss implications for readmission reduction efforts. Drawing on our clinical, research and operational experiences, we offer suggestions to address the key challenges in moving forward to measure and reduce preventable readmissions.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>L., Findlay</author><author>L, Findlay</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rates of avoidable readmissions in emergency surgery at a district general hospital</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Surgery</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Surgery</full-title></periodical><pages>S88-S88</pages><volume>12</volume><keywords><keyword>*emergency surgery</keyword><keyword>*general hospital</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*human</keyword><keyword>*surgeon</keyword><keyword>analgesia</keyword><keyword>antibiotic agent</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>follow up</keyword><keyword>gallstone</keyword><keyword>general surgery</keyword><keyword>health statistics</keyword><keyword>hospital bed</keyword><keyword>hospital patient</keyword><keyword>infection</keyword><keyword>medical audit</keyword><keyword>pain</keyword><keyword>patient</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><pub-location>L.

Following a 25% cut in surgical beds at a busy district general hospital, we audited emergency surgery readmission rates. Methods: Data were collected over six months (August 2012-February 2013). 120 readmissions were identified. A standard of 9% readmissions within 28 days of discharge was set based on Department of Health statistics for national general surgery readmissions (2008). Readmissions were classified as potentially avoidable or non-avoidable. Avoidable readmissions were further categorised by reason for readmission. Results: Readmission rates were consistently below the audit standard (5.8%). However, 53.4% of readmissions with recurrent symptoms and 57% with complications of treatment were potentially avoidable. 33% of patients readmitted were not given a definitive diagnosis on initial admission. Missed diagnosis prevented 10% from receiving definitive treatment on first admission. Significant avoidable causes included incomplete treatment of infection, lack of definitive treatment of gallstones, and mismanagement of post-operative pain. Older patients were more likely to be readmitted and readmission within 48 hours was most common. Conclusions: Readmissions may be predicted and potentially avoided. Timely follow-up, urgent-elective surgical treatment and appropriate antibiotic and analgesia prescribing may reduce readmission.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fischer, Claudia</author><author>Lingsma, Hester F</author><author>Marang-van de Mheen, Perla J</author><author>Kringos, Dionne S</author><author>Klazinga, Niek S</author><author>Steyerberg, Ewout W</author><author>C., Fischer</author><author>H.F., Lingsma</author><author>P.J., Marang-van de Mheen</author><author>D.S., Kringos</author><author>N.S., Klazinga</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Is the readmission rate a valid quality indicator?

However, the validity of readmission rates as a measure of quality of hospital care is not evident. We aimed to give an overview of the different methodological aspects in the definition and measurement of readmission rates that need to be considered when interpreting readmission rates as a reflection of quality of care. METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review, using the bibliographic databases Embase, Medline OvidSP, Web-of-Science, Cochrane central and PubMed for the period of January 2001 to May 2013. RESULTS: The search resulted in 102 included papers. We found that definition of the context in which readmissions are used as a quality indicator is crucial. This context includes the patient group and the specific aspects of care of which the quality is aimed to be assessed. Methodological flaws like unreliable data and insufficient case-mix correction may confound the comparison of readmission rates between hospitals. Another problem occurs when the basic distinction between planned and unplanned readmissions cannot be made. Finally, the multi-faceted nature of quality of care and the correlation between readmissions and other outcomes limit the indicator's validity. CONCLUSIONS: Although readmission rates are a promising quality indicator, several methodological concerns identified in this study need to be addressed, especially when the indicator is intended for accountability or pay for performance. We recommend investing resources in accurate data registration, improved indicator description, and bundling outcome measures to provide a more complete picture of hospital care.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brown, Erin G</author><author>Burgess, Debra</author><author>Li, Chin-Shang</author><author>Canter, Robert J</author><author>Bold, Richard J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hospital readmissions: necessary evil or preventable target for quality improvement.</title><secondary-title>Annals of surgery</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of surgery</full-title></periodical><pages>583-591</pages><volume>260</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Cancer Care Facilities</keyword><keyword>Dehydration</keyword><keyword>Health Care Costs</keyword><keyword>Hospitals</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Infection</keyword><keyword>Length of Stay</keyword><keyword>Neoplasms</keyword><keyword>Operative</keyword><keyword>Pain, Postoperative</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Postoperative</keyword><keyword>Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting</keyword><keyword>Quality Improvement</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Surgical Procedures, Operative</keyword><keyword>Thromboembolism</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>economics</keyword><keyword>standards</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>25203874</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1097/SLA.0000000000000923</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVES: To evaluate readmission rates and associated factors to identify potentially preventable readmissions. BACKGROUND: The decision to penalize hospitals for readmissions is compelling health care systems to develop processes to minimize readmissions. Research to identify preventable readmissions is critical to achieve these goals. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of University HealthSystem Consortium database for cancer patients hospitalized from January 2010 to September 2013. Outcome measures were 7-, 14-, and 30-day readmission rates and readmission diagnoses. Hospital and disease characteristics were evaluated to evaluate relationships with readmission. RESULTS: A total of 2,517,886 patients were hospitalized for cancer treatment. Readmission rates at 7, 14, and 30 days were 2.2%, 3.7%, and 5.6%, respectively. Despite concern that premature hospital discharge may be associated with increased readmissions, a shorter initial length of stay predicted lower readmission rates. Furthermore, high-volume centers and designated cancer centers had higher readmission rates. Evaluating institutional data (N = 2517 patients) demonstrated that factors associated with higher readmission rates include discharge from a medical service, site of malignancy, and emergency primary admission. When examining readmission within 7 days for surgical services, the most common readmission diagnoses were infectious causes (46.3%), nausea/vomiting/dehydration (26.8%), and pain (6.1%). CONCLUSIONS: A minority of patients after hospitalization for cancer-related therapy are readmitted with potentially preventable conditions such as nausea, vomiting, dehydration, and pain. However, most factors associated with readmission cannot be modified. In addition, high-volume centers and designated cancer centers have higher readmission rates, which may indicate that readmission rates may not be an appropriate marker for quality improvement.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ryan, Jason</author><author>Andrews, Rebecca</author><author>Barry, Mary Beth</author><author>Kang, Sangwook</author><author>Iskandar, Aline</author><author>Mehla, Priti</author><author>Ganeshan, Raj</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Preventability of 30-day readmissions for heart failure patients before and after a quality improvement initiative.</title><secondary-title>American journal of medical quality : the official journal of the American College of Medical Quality</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American journal of medical quality : the official journal of the American College of Medical Quality</full-title></periodical><pages>220-226</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>80 and over</keyword><keyword>Aged, 80 and over</keyword><keyword>Connecticut</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Program Evaluation</keyword><keyword>Quality Improvement</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>therapy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><accession-num>23956341</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/1062860613496135</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>The objective of this study was to estimate the frequency of heart failure (HF) readmissions that can be prevented through a quality improvement (QI) program.

The rate of readmission exceeds patients' baseline rate of hospitalization, and also exceeds the rate after matched nonsepsis hospitalizations [1]. We sought to determine the most common readmission diagnoses after severe sepsis, the extent to which readmissions may be preventable, and whether the pattern of readmission diagnoses differs from that of nonsepsis hospitalizations. Methods: We studied participants in the US Health and Retirement Study with linked Medicare claims (1998 to 2010) [2]. Using validated methods [3,4], we identified severe sepsis and nonsepsis hospitalizations, then measured 90-day readmissions in each cohort. Using Healthcare Cost &amp; Utilization Project's Clinical Classification Software [5], we determined the 10 most common readmission diagnoses after severe sepsis. We measured rates of 'potentially preventable' readmissions using published definitions [6]. We compared rates of all-cause, potentially preventable, and causespecific hospitalizations between survivors of severe sepsis and nonsepsis hospitalizations using chi-squared tests. Results: We identified 3,703 severe sepsis and 44,840 nonsepsis hospitalizations, of which 3,036 (82.0%) and 43,539 (93.1%) survived to discharge, respectively. In the next 90 days, 43.6% of severe sepsis survivors were rehospitalized, compared to 34.8% of nonsepsis survivors, P &lt; 0.001. The top readmission diagnoses following severe sepsis (Table 1) included several recognized potentially preventable diagnoses: heart failure, pneumonia, exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and urinary infection. Also common were readmissions for sepsis, acute renal failure, and aspiration pneumonitis, diagnoses that could plausibly be prevented or treated early to prevent hospitalization. Patterns of readmission differed in severe sepsis survivors; rates of readmission for sepsis, renal failure, respiratory failure, device complication, and aspiration pneumonitis were higher and accounted for a greater proportion of the total readmissions. Potentially preventable hospitalizations - infection (sepsis, pneumonia, urinary tract, and skin or soft tissue), heart failure, COPD exacerbation, acute renal failure, and aspiration pneumonitis - accounted for 40.5% of all readmissions after severe sepsis (compared to 25.8% following nonsepsis admission, P &lt; 0.001), and 19.6% of severe sepsis survivors experienced a readmission for one of these diagnoses (compared to 9.5% following a nonsepsis admission, P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Forty percent of hospitalizations after severe sepsis occur for diagnoses that may be preventable. A few disease categories account for a relatively large proportion of the hospitalizations after severe sepsis, suggesting the feasibility of tailoring postdischarge interventions to patient's personalized risk for these common postsepsis diagnoses.

The aim of this study was to identify the rate of preventable readmissions within 30 days of discharge after initial hospitalization for pneumonia and to identify reasons for readmission and possible areas for improvement. Methods We performed a retrospective medical chart review of all patients admitted with a diagnosis code of pneumonia (ICD Codes 480.0-483.99, 485-486.99, 487, or 507.0); or a principal diagnosis of septicemia or respiratory failure (ICD-9-CM codes 038.XX or 518.81) and a secondary diagnosis of pneumonia, readmitted to the hospital for any reason within 30 days of discharge, from January to December 2011 in the University of Connecticut Health Center. Two physicians (a pulmonary and critical care fellow and an internal medicine resident) reviewed the medical records independently and in a blinded fashion, determined whether the readmission was preventable or not, based on standard of care and their clinical experience. The third clinician (pulmonary and critical care faculty) adjudicated after his independent review if there was disagreement between the two reviewers on any patient. Results There were 67 readmissions within 30 days after an index pneumonia hospitalization. Of these, 13 (19.4%) were excluded as the index admission was not determined to be due to pneumonia. Of the 54 readmissions, the two independent reviewers agreed that only 4 (7.4%) were preventable. There was disagreement on 4 (7.4%) patients, and of these, 1 was considered preventable by the third reviewer. Of the 5 with potentially preventable readmissions, 3 were readmitted for CHF exacerbation, one for malnutrition, and one for pericardial tamponade. The 54 readmissions involved 41 patients. There were 10 patients with &gt; 2 readmissions, half of whom had sickle cell disease, the other half were aged &gt;87 years old. Of the 49 patients with non-preventable readmissions, 11 (22.4%) were related to pneumonia. Four out of 11 (36.4%) had known aspiration risks, while the rest had co-morbidities including cystic fibrosis, COPD, CHF, HIV, and sickle cell disease. Other readmissions were mostly due to reasons unrelated to the initial pneumonia but secondary to underlying co-morbid conditions. Conclusion These results suggest that although it seems laudable to target reduction of 30-day readmissions after a hospitalization for pneumonia, most factors affecting readmission may not be amenable to in-hospital or care transition modification.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S, Almeida</author><author>E, Ha</author><author>A, Busuttil</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Readmission reduction initiative (RRI): Characterizing the 30-day readmission population and identifying predictors of preventability</title><secondary-title>Journal of General Internal Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of General Internal Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>S193-S194</pages><volume>29</volume><keywords><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*human</keyword><keyword>*internal medicine</keyword><keyword>*population</keyword><keyword>*society</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>anticoagulation</keyword><keyword>chronic disease</keyword><keyword>documentation</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>follow up</keyword><keyword>hospital discharge</keyword><keyword>implantable cardioverter defibrillator</keyword><keyword>medical student</keyword><keyword>medication therapy management</keyword><keyword>nurse</keyword><keyword>patient</keyword><keyword>physician</keyword><keyword>procedures</keyword><keyword>relapse</keyword><keyword>sample size</keyword><keyword>university</keyword><keyword>university hospital</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><pub-location>S.

We sought to characterize the 30-day readmission population at a major academic medical center, the Ronald Reagan Medical Center at the University of California, Los Angeles (RRUCLA). This study also assesses the root cause and preventability of each readmission with the aim of finding potential predictors of preventable readmissions. METHODS: From 1/1/2012 to 1/16/2013, 3,848 cases of 30-day readmissions were identified. Chart abstractions were performed by physicians, medical students, and nurses. Documentation review was limited to the history and physical (H&amp;P) and discharge summary for the index admission and readmission event. RESULTS: To date, 611 chart abstractions have been completed, of which 67.4 % were found to be not preventable (NP), 23.5 % potentially preventable (PP), and 9.1 % preventable (P). The majority of readmissions were due to relapse, or worsening of chronic illness, accounting for approximately 44.5 % of cases; another 30.4 % were due to a new, unrelated event. Planned admissions, medication or procedure adverse events, and inadequate discharge planning accounted for 11.3 %, 6.5 %, and 4.1 % respectively. Quality of care during the index admission and access to care issues together accounted for just over 3.1 % of abstracted cases. CONCLUSIONS: The data shows that the number of unpreventable admissions far outnumbers preventable ones. Trends point to high utilization of the ER, new anticoagulation starts, discharge medication reconciliation, and effective postdischarge follow-up as potential targets of future intervention. However, the current sample size is too small to draw any definite conclusions regarding predictors of preventability.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tejedor-Sojo, Javier</author><author>Singleton, Lori M</author><author>McCormick, Kelly</author><author>Wrubel, David</author><author>Chern, Joshua J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Preventability of Pediatric 30-Day Readmissions following Ventricular Shunt Surgery.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of pediatrics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of pediatrics</full-title></periodical><pages>1327-33.e1</pages><volume>167</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Child</keyword><keyword>Child, Preschool</keyword><keyword>Equipment Failure</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hospitals, Pediatric</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Infant</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Neurosurgical Procedures</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Reoperation</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>trends</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26454576</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jpeds.2015.09.017</electronic-resource-num><notes>Investigate further</notes><research-notes>Investigate further</research-notes><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To compare the preventability of 30-day pediatric ventricular shunt readmissions using clinical and administrative data review. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective chart review of one hundred forty-seven 30-day ventricular shunt readmissions at a tertiary pediatric center from May 2009-April 2013 under 2 scenarios: scenario 1 considered all ventricular shunt failures preventable; and scenario 2 considered shunt failures with excellent/good catheter positioning and no contributing deficiencies in care not preventable. Three physician reviewers independently assessed readmissions to determine their preventability and whether deficiencies in care existed that contributed to the readmission. We also evaluated the degree of interrater agreement in adjudicating readmission preventability. RESULTS: Only 42% of 30-day readmissions following ventricular shunt procedures were preventable when considering all shunt failures as preventable. When classifying shunts with excellent/good proximal catheter position as not preventable, 21% of ventricular shunt readmissions were deemed preventable. Interrater agreement on readmission preventability was high (kappa 0.88). Deficiencies in care existed in 29 readmissions (20%), the largest category being physician related, but not all deficiencies contributed to a readmission. CONCLUSIONS: Significant discrepancy exists in the preventability adjudication of ventricular shunt readmissions between administrative and chart review. Although using administrative data has determined that a majority of readmissions following pediatric ventricular shunt procedures are preventable, our review suggests a significantly lower degree of preventability.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Danino, J F</author><author>Taylor, T</author><author>Metcalfe, C W</author><author>Muzaffar, S J</author><author>Sinha, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Readmission rates and financial penalties after ear, nose and throat surgery: how can we improve?</title><secondary-title>British journal of hospital medicine (London, England : 2005)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>British journal of hospital medicine (London, England : 2005)</full-title></periodical><pages>655-657</pages><volume>76</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Great Britain</keyword><keyword>Health Care</keyword><keyword>Health Care Costs</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Incentive</keyword><keyword>Otorhinolaryngologic Surgical Procedures</keyword><keyword>Patient Discharge Summaries</keyword><keyword>Patient Education as Topic</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Postoperative Care</keyword><keyword>Quality Assurance, Health Care</keyword><keyword>Reimbursement, Incentive</keyword><keyword>adverse effects</keyword><keyword>economics</keyword><keyword>organization &amp; administration</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>26551496</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.12968/hmed.2015.76.11.655</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>INTRODUCTION: Since April 2011, all patient readmissions within 30 days have resulted in a financial penalty to the hospital trust, and therefore the responsible department. These costs may be substantial and potentially preventable. METHODS: A service evaluation of readmissions within 30 days of discharge, over a 12-month period (January-December 2012), was performed in the ear, nose and throat department of a district general hospital, and findings were used as a basis to suggest areas for potential quality improvement. AIMS: To determine the number of readmissions, causes of readmission and resulting costs, and to explore how these readmissions may be prevented. RESULTS: The departmental 30-day readmission rate over the study period was 3.12% (81/2606). The commonest causes of readmission (33.3%) were complications following tonsillectomy (27/81) such as pain, infection or bleeding. Over a third of these patients (30/81) were readmitted for less than 24 hours, with the average length of stay being less than 2.5 days. Financial implications: In 2011 the trust had 7526 emergency readmissions which were eligible for penalty within the 30-day time frame. This resulted in a loss of income of more than pound60 000 to the ear, nose and throat department. CONCLUSIONS: Optimizing postoperative care and improving patient understanding of common complications may reduce readmission rates, thus limiting the financial burden on the trust. These areas could serve as a basis for future quality improvement projects.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Burjonrappa, S</author><author>Theodorus, A</author><author>Shah, A</author><author>Cohen, I T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pediatric surgery readmissions: a root cause analysis.</title><secondary-title>Pediatric surgery international</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pediatric surgery international</full-title></periodical><pages>551-555</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Child</keyword><keyword>Child, Preschool</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Hospitals, Pediatric</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Infant</keyword><keyword>Infant, Newborn</keyword><keyword>Length of Stay</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Postoperative Complications</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Root Cause Analysis</keyword><keyword>Tertiary Care Centers</keyword><keyword>Young Adult</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>25877671</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00383-015-3701-4</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>INTRODUCTION: Hospital readmission rates are used as a metric of the quality of patient care in adults. Readmission data is lacking for pediatric surgical patients. The objective of this study is to evaluate our institution's 30-day unexpected pediatric surgical readmission data to identify potentially preventable readmissions. METHODS: An internal database of all pediatric surgical 30-day readmissions to two tertiary-referral children's hospitals in a single health system was reviewed. All pediatric general surgery admissions between January 2008 and May 2013 with hospital readmission within 30 days were included in the study. Patient demographics, diagnoses, cause of readmission, procedure performed, and length of stay were recorded. Charts were individually reviewed to evaluate causality of readmission. RESULTS: There were 2217 pediatric general surgery admissions during the study period. Of these, 145 (6.5%) experienced unexpected readmission within 30 days. One-third of all readmissions occurred in infants between 0 and 364 days of age, 50% occurred in those under 2 years and wholly 80% of all readmissions occurred in those under 9 years of age. A majority of readmissions were associated with chronic comorbid conditions. CONCLUSION: Analysis of pediatric surgical readmission data may assist hospitals in focusing quality of care and cost effectiveness strategies. Development of coordination of care strategies and discharge planning involving both pediatric surgical teams and pediatric hospitalists/specialists may reduce pediatric surgical readmission rates.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Merkow, Ryan P</author><author>Ju, Mila H</author><author>Chung, Jeanette W</author><author>Hall, Bruce L</author><author>Cohen, Mark E</author><author>Williams, Mark V</author><author>Tsai, Thomas C</author><author>Ko, Clifford Y</author><author>Bilimoria, Karl Y</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Underlying reasons associated with hospital readmission following surgery in the United States.</title><secondary-title>JAMA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JAMA</full-title></periodical><pages>483-495</pages><volume>313</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>80 and over</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Aged, 80 and over</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Operative</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Postoperative Complications</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Surgical Procedures, Operative</keyword><keyword>Surgical Wound Infection</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><accession-num>25647204</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1001/jama.2014.18614</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>IMPORTANCE: Financial penalties for readmission have been expanded beyond medical conditions to include surgical procedures. Hospitals are working to reduce readmissions; however, little is known about the reasons for surgical readmission. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the reasons, timing, and factors associated with unplanned postoperative readmissions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Patients undergoing surgery at one of 346 continuously enrolled US hospitals participating in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS NSQIP) between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2012, had clinically abstracted information examined. Readmission rates and reasons (ascertained by clinical data abstractors at each hospital) were assessed for all surgical procedures and for 6 representative operations: bariatric procedures, colectomy or proctectomy, hysterectomy, total hip or knee arthroplasty, ventral hernia repair, and lower extremity vascular bypass. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Unplanned 30-day readmission and reason for readmission. RESULTS: The unplanned readmission rate for the 498,875 operations was 5.7%. For the individual procedures, the readmission rate ranged from 3.8% for hysterectomy to 14.9% for lower extremity vascular bypass. The most common reason for unplanned readmission was surgical site infection (SSI) overall (19.5%) and also after colectomy or proctectomy (25.8%), ventral hernia repair (26.5%), hysterectomy (28.8%), arthroplasty (18.8%), and lower extremity vascular bypass (36.4%). Obstruction or ileus was the most common reason for readmission after bariatric surgery (24.5%) and the second most common reason overall (10.3%), after colectomy or proctectomy (18.1%), ventral hernia repair (16.7%), and hysterectomy (13.4%). Only 2.3% of patients were readmitted for the same complication they had experienced during their index hospitalization. Only 3.3% of patients readmitted for SSIs had experienced an SSI during their index hospitalization. There was no time pattern for readmission, and early (&lt;/=7 days postdischarge) and late (&gt;7 days postdischarge) readmissions were associated with the same 3 most common reasons: SSI, ileus or obstruction, and bleeding. Patient comorbidities, index surgical admission complications, non-home discharge (hazard ratio [HR], 1.40 [95% CI, 1.35-1.46]), teaching hospital status (HR, 1.14 [95% CI 1.07-1.21]), and higher surgical volume (HR, 1.15 [95% CI, 1.07-1.25]) were associated with a higher risk of hospital readmission. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Readmissions after surgery were associated with new postdischarge complications related to the procedure and not exacerbation of prior index hospitalization complications, suggesting that readmissions after surgery are a measure of postdischarge complications. These data should be considered when developing quality indicators and any policies penalizing hospitals for surgical readmission.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shams, Issac</author><author>Ajorlou, Saeede</author><author>Yang, Kai</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A predictive analytics approach to reducing 30-day avoidable readmissions among patients with heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, pneumonia, or COPD</title><secondary-title>Health care management science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Health care management science</full-title></periodical><pages>19-34</pages><volume>18</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Algorithms</keyword><keyword>Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (U.S.)</keyword><keyword>Chronic Obstructive</keyword><keyword>Comorbidity</keyword><keyword>Data Interpretation</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Length of Stay</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Michigan</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Myocardial Infarction</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Pneumonia</keyword><keyword>Probability</keyword><keyword>Pulmonary Disease</keyword><keyword>Quality of Health Care</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Socioeconomic Factors</keyword><keyword>Statistical</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>United States Department of Veterans Affairs</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>therapy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>Netherlands</pub-location><isbn>1386-9620</isbn><accession-num>24792081</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10729-014-9278-y</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=emed13&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=24792081</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Hospital readmission has become a critical metric of quality and cost of healthcare. Medicare anticipates that nearly $17 billion is paid out on the 20 % of patients who are readmitted within 30 days of discharge. Although several interventions such as transition care management have been practiced in recent years, the effectiveness and sustainability depends on how well they can identify patients at high risk of rehospitalization. Based on the literature, most current risk prediction models fail to reach an acceptable accuracy level; none of them considers patient's history of readmission and impacts of patient attribute changes over time; and they often do not discriminate between planned and unnecessary readmissions. Tackling such drawbacks, we develop a new readmission metric based on administrative data that can identify potentially avoidable readmissions from all other types of readmission. We further propose a tree-based classification method to estimate the predicted probability of readmission that can directly incorporate patient's history of readmission and risk factors changes over time. The proposed methods are validated with 2011-12 Veterans Health Administration data from inpatients hospitalized for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, pneumonia, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the State of Michigan. Results shows improved discrimination power compared to the literature (c-statistics &gt;80 %) and good calibration.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Soong, Christine</author><author>Bell, Chaim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identifying preventable readmissions: An achievable goal or waiting for Godot?</title><secondary-title>BMJ Quality and Safety</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMJ Quality and Safety</full-title></periodical><pages>741-743</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>editorial</keyword><keyword>health care access</keyword><keyword>health care delivery</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>medical record review</keyword><keyword>pneumonia</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>C.

OBJECTIVES: To develop an algorithm to identify planned readmissions, describe its performance characteristics, and identify improvements. DESIGN: Consensus-driven algorithm development and chart review validation study at 7 acute-care hospitals in 2 health systems. PATIENTS: For development, all discharges qualifying for the publicly reported hospital-wide readmission measure. For validation, all qualifying same-hospital readmissions that were characterized by the algorithm as planned, and a random sampling of same-hospital readmissions that were characterized as unplanned. MEASUREMENTS: We calculated weighted sensitivity and specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of the algorithm (version 2.1), compared to gold standard chart review. RESULTS: In consultation with 27 experts, we developed an algorithm that characterizes 7.8% of readmissions as planned. For validation we reviewed 634 readmissions. The weighted sensitivity of the algorithm was 45.1% overall, 50.9% in large teaching centers and 40.2% in smaller community hospitals. The weighted specificity was 95.9%, positive predictive value was 51.6%, and negative predictive value was 94.7%. We identified 4 minor changes to improve algorithm performance. The revised algorithm had a weighted sensitivity 49.8% (57.1% at large hospitals), weighted specificity 96.5%, positive predictive value 58.7%, and negative predictive value 94.5%. Positive predictive value was poor for the 2 most common potentially planned procedures: diagnostic cardiac catheterization (25%) and procedures involving cardiac devices (33%). CONCLUSIONS: An administrative claims-based algorithm to identify planned readmissions is feasible and can facilitate public reporting of primarily unplanned readmissions.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><titles><title>Comment on: Predicting potentially preventable hospital readmissions following bariatric surgery</title><secondary-title>Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases</full-title></periodical><pages>872-873</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>*bariatric surgery</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*prevention</keyword><keyword>editorial</keyword><keyword>health care delivery</keyword><keyword>health care system</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>patient care</keyword><keyword>patient satisfaction</keyword><keyword>prediction</keyword><keyword>priority journal</keyword><keyword>tertiary care center</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>D.S.

Area under the curve (AUC) analysis was used to determine the time interval that best captured unplanned readmission., BACKGROUND: Readmission rates of 9.7% to 15.5% after hepatectomy have been reported. These rates are difficult to interpret due to variability in the time interval used to monitor readmission. The aim of this study was to refine the definition of readmission after hepatectomy., RESULTS: Readmission rates at 30 days, 90 days, and 1 year after discharge were 10.7% (n = 326), 17.3% (n = 526), and 31.9% (n = 971) respectively. The time interval that best accounted for unplanned readmissions was 45 days after discharge (AUC, 0.956; p &lt; 0.001), during which 389 patients (12.8%) were readmitted (unplanned: n = 312 [10.3%]; planned: n = 77 [2.5%]). In comparison, the 30 days after surgery interval (used in the ACS-NSQIP database) omitted 65 (26.3%) unplanned readmissions. Multivariate analysis revealed the following risk factors for unplanned readmission: diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 1.6; p = 0.024), right hepatectomy (OR 2.1; p = 0.034), bile duct resection (OR 1.9; p = 0.034), abdominal complication (OR 1.8; p = 0.010), and a major postoperative complication (OR 2.4; p &lt; 0.001). Neither index hospitalization &gt; 7 days nor postoperative hepatobiliary complications were independently associated with readmission., CONCLUSIONS: To accurately assess readmission after hepatectomy, patients should be monitored 45 days after discharge.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Saunders, Neil David</author><author>Nichols, Shawnn D</author><author>Antiporda, Michael Alfredo</author><author>Johnson, Kristen</author><author>Walker, Kerri</author><author>Nilsson, Rhonda</author><author>Graham, Lisa</author><author>Old, Matt</author><author>Klisovic, Rebecca B</author><author>Penza, Sam</author><author>Schmidt, Carl R</author><author>N.D., Saunders</author><author>S.D., Nichols</author><author>M.A., Antiporda</author><author>K., Johnson</author><author>K., Walker</author><author>R., Nilsson</author><author>L., Graham</author><author>M., Old</author><author>R.B., Klisovic</author><author>S., Penza</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Examination of unplanned 30-day readmissions to a comprehensive cancer hospital</title><secondary-title>Journal of oncology practice / American Society of Clinical Oncology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of oncology practice / American Society of Clinical Oncology</full-title></periodical><pages>e177-e181</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>*cancer center</keyword><keyword>*comprehensive cancer hospital</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>80 and over</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Cancer Care Facilities</keyword><keyword>Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (U.S.)</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Inpatients</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>Young Adult</keyword><keyword>adult</keyword><keyword>aged</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>cancer growth</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>major clinical study</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>medicaid</keyword><keyword>medical record</keyword><keyword>medicare</keyword><keyword>postoperative complication/co [Complication]</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>total parenteral nutrition</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>C.R.

Such penalties imply that some readmissions reflect poor clinical decision making or care during the initial hospitalization. We examined factors related to potentially preventable readmissions in CMS patients at a tertiary cancer hospital. METHODS: The medical records of all CMS patients with unplanned readmissions within 30 days of index admission were reviewed over 6 months (October 15, 2011-April 15, 2012). Each readmission was classified as not preventable or potentially preventable. Factors associated with potentially preventable readmissions were sought. RESULTS: Of 2,531 inpatient admissions in CMS patients over 6 months, 185 patients experienced at least one readmission for 282 total readmissions (11%). Median time to readmission was 9 days (range, 0 to 30 days). The most common causes for first readmission were new diagnoses not present at first admission (n = 43, 23%), new or worsening symptoms due to cancer progression (n = 40, 21%) and complications of procedures (n = 25, 13%). There were 38 (21%) initial readmissions classified as potentially preventable. Use of total parenteral nutrition at the time of discharge was associated with potentially preventable readmission (P = .028). CONCLUSION: Most unplanned readmissions to a tertiary cancer hospital are related to progression of disease, new diagnoses, and procedure complications. Minimizing readmissions in complex cancer patients is challenging. Larger multi-institutional datasets are needed to determine a reasonable standard for expected readmission rates.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Blunt, Ian</author><author>Bardsley, Martin</author><author>Grove, Amy</author><author>Clarke, Aileen</author><author>I., Blunt</author><author>M., Bardsley</author><author>A., Grove</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Classifying emergency 30-day readmissions in England using routine hospital data 2004-2010: What is the scope for reduction?</title><secondary-title>Emergency Medicine Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Emergency Medicine Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>44-50</pages><volume>32</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>*emergency care</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>England</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>International Classification of Diseases</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Quality of Health Care</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Risk Factors</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>United Kingdom</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>artifact</keyword><keyword>chronic disease</keyword><keyword>classification</keyword><keyword>hospital</keyword><keyword>hospital care</keyword><keyword>hospital discharge</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>long term care</keyword><keyword>medical record</keyword><keyword>national health service</keyword><keyword>retrospective study</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>A.

The purpose of this study was to develop an exploratory categorisation based on likely causes of readmission, and then to assess the prevalence of these different types. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of 82 million routinely collected National Health Service hospital records in England (2004-2010) was undertaken using anonymised linkage of records at person-level. Numbers of 30-day readmissions were calculated. Exploratory categorisation of readmissions was applied using simple rules relating to International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnostic codes for both admission and readmission. RESULTS: There were 5 804 472 emergency 30-day readmissions over a 6-year period, equivalent to 7.0% of hospital discharges. Readmissions were grouped into hierarchically exclusive categories: potentially preventable readmission (1 739 519 (30.0% of readmissions)); anticipated but unpredictable readmission (patients with chronic disease or likely to need long-term care; 1 141 987 (19.7%)); preference-related readmission (53 718 (0.9%)); artefact of data collection (16 062 (0.3%)); readmission as a result of accident, coincidence or related to a different body system (1 101 818 (19.0%)); broadly related readmission (readmission related to the same body system (1 751 368 (30.2%)). CONCLUSIONS: In this exploratory categorisation, a large minority of emergency readmissions (eg, those that are potentially preventable or due to data artefacts) fell into groups potentially amenable to immediate reduction. For other categories, a hospital's ability to reduce emergency readmission is less clear. Reduction strategies and payment incentives must be carefully tailored to achieve stated aims.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nijhawan, Ank E</author><author>Kitchell, Ellen</author><author>Etherton, Sarah Shelby</author><author>Duarte, Piper</author><author>Halm, Ethan A</author><author>Jain, Mamta K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Half of 30-Day Hospital Readmissions among HIV-Infected Patients Are Potentially Preventable</title><secondary-title>AIDS Patient Care and STDs</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>AIDS Patient Care and STDs</full-title></periodical><pages>465-473</pages><volume>29</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Electronic Health Records</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>HIV Infections</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Outcome Assessment (Health Care)</keyword><keyword>Patient Discharge</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>Socioeconomic Factors</keyword><keyword>Texas</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>Urban Population</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>therapy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>A.E.

However, it is unknown how many 30-day readmissions are preventable, especially in HIV patients, who have been excluded from prior potentially preventable readmission analyses. We used electronic medical records to identify all readmissions within 30 days of discharge among HIV patients hospitalized at a large urban safety net hospital in 2011. Two independent reviewers assessed whether readmissions were potentially preventable using both published criteria and detailed chart review, how readmissions might have been prevented, and the phase of care deemed suboptimal (inpatient care, discharge planning, post-discharge). Of 1137 index admissions, 213 (19%) resulted in 30-day readmissions. These admissions occurred among 930 unique HIV patients, with 130 individuals (14%) experiencing 30-day readmissions. Of these 130, about half were determined to be potentially preventable using published criteria (53%) or implicit chart review (48%). Not taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) greatly increased the odds of a preventable readmission (OR 5.9, CI:2.4-14.8). Most of the preventable causes of readmission were attributed to suboptimal care during the index hospitalization. Half of 30-day readmission in HIV patients are potentially preventable. Increased focus on early ART initiation, adherence counseling, management of chronic conditions, and appropriate timing of discharge may help reduce readmissions in this vulnerable population.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>A, Mathew</author><author>R, Pekmezaris</author><author>L, Rosen</author><author>A, Kozikowski</author><author>T, McGinn</author><author>K, Kalantar-Zadeh</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Potentially preventable readmissions in chronic hemodialysis patients</title><secondary-title>Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation</full-title></periodical><pages>iii303-iii303</pages><volume>30</volume><keywords><keyword>*edetic acid</keyword><keyword>*hemodialysis</keyword><keyword>*hemodialysis patient</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*human</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>algorithm</keyword><keyword>cohort analysis</keyword><keyword>day hospital</keyword><keyword>dialysis</keyword><keyword>economics</keyword><keyword>end stage renal disease</keyword><keyword>health</keyword><keyword>hospital patient</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>infection</keyword><keyword>information processing</keyword><keyword>kidney function</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>medicare</keyword><keyword>nonparametric test</keyword><keyword>nursing home</keyword><keyword>patient</keyword><keyword>population</keyword><keyword>quality of life</keyword><keyword>rehabilitation</keyword><keyword>risk</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>A.

These rates are twice that of the general U.S Medicare population. While some readmissions are unavoidable, a substantial number could probably be avoided with optimal care - for example, management of volume overload. Despite the negative impact on patients' quality of life and adverse health outcomes and economics there remains a dearth of evidence regarding predictors of 30-day readmission in these patients. We aim to describe frequencies, correlates and length of stay of potentially avoidable 30-day readmissions in hemodialysis patients. Methods: Retrospective cohort study using United States Renal Data System (USRDS). Prevalent hemodialysis patients (vintage &gt;90 days) with acute hospitalizations from January 1, 2008, through December 1, 2008 were included. All 30-day readmissions up to December 31, 2008, were assessed. To ensure that our patient cohort reflected only hemodialysis patients who were discharged home after an index hospitalization, transfers on day of discharge to inpatient rehabilitation facility or skilled nursing facility, unknown hemodialysis start dates, &quot;recovery of renal function&quot; during the treatment period, and patients receiving less than 90 days of dialysis were excluded. The primary outcome was potentially preventable 30-day readmission, identified using a validated computerized algorithm based on administrative data (SQLape). Continuous variables were expressed as mean with standard deviation (SD) or median with interquartile range. Variables were compared with parametric or nonparametric tests, as appropriate. Results: 250,606 index hospitalizations were identified, of which 37% were readmitted within 30 days. The median time to potentially avoidable readmission was 11 days (IQR 5 to 14). Shorter length of stay of the index hospitalization was associated with a higher risk of potentially avoidable readmission (See Table 1). Among all index hospitalizations 24% had a potentially avoidable 30-day readmission (See Figure 1). Among the potentially avoidable readmissions, 35% and 24% were cardiac- or infection-related, respectively. Patients with potentially avoidable readmissions were more likely to be younger and black. Conclusions: After an acute index hospitalization, nearly one quarter of chronic hemodialysis patients have a potentially preventable 30-day readmission. Future studies to develop and test interventions to reduce the risk of preventable 30-day hospital readmission in ESRD are warranted.

Previous studies have defined the readmission interval as either &quot;30-Days from Discharge&quot; or &quot;90- Days from Surgery&quot;. The objective of this study was to determine which of these definitions best captures readmissions that occur as a direct result of surgical complications after pancreatectomy. Methods: A prospectively maintained database at a high volume HPB surgery center was queried to identify individuals who underwent pancreatectomy between 2000 and 2012. All cases of readmission in the 365 days following the initial operation were identified, indexed by cause, and stratified according to a standard grading scale. Unplanned disease-related readmissions were defined as those caused by symptoms of radiologically or pathologically confirmed disease progression. All other unplanned readmissions were defined as complication-related readmissions and categorized. The data was analyzed at 30-days after discharge and 90-days after operation in order to compare the capture rates of complication- related readmissions. Multivariable analysis assessed risk-factors for readmission at each time point. Results: During the study period, 1,123 patients were discharged from hospitalization after pancreatectomy. Complication-related readmissions occurred in 248 (22%) individuals while readmissions related to disease progression occurred in 25 (2%) individuals. For patients with a complication-related readmission, 93 (37.5%) readmissions were associated with a major adverse event requiring intervention or ICU admission. The &quot;30-Days from Discharge&quot; definition encompassed 184 complication-related readmissions and 1 disease-related readmission (sensitivity: 0.74, specificity: 0.96). In contrast, the &quot;90- Days from Surgery&quot; definition captured 215 complication-related readmissions and 1 diseaserelated readmission (sensitivity 0.87, specificity 0.96). The &quot;30-Days from Discharge&quot; definition captured only 66 (sensitivity 0.71) major surgical complications, while the &quot;90-Days from Surgery&quot; definition captured 84 major surgical complications (sensitivity 0.90). For the subset of readmissions uniquely captured by the &quot;90-Days from Surgery&quot; definition, major complication was the only independent risk factor for readmission (p=0.02, HR: 3.94, 95% CI 1.44-12.22). Conclusions: The &quot;90-Days from Pancreatectomy&quot; readmission definition more precisely captures readmissions directly related to surgical morbidity, particularly those associated with major complications. These data indicate that this readmission definition should routinely be used after pancreatectomy.

The expected readmission rate and number of preventable readmissions are difficult to determine. We sought to identify preventable readmissions at an academic medical center in anticipation of CMS pay-for-performance inclusion of 30-day readmission rate as a quality measure. Methods: Fiscal year 2013 readmissions data were obtained from the Office of Clinical Practice Evaluation. Administrative readmissions were removed and individual chart reviews completed for NIHSS, clinical diagnosis at readmission, and potential contributing factors. Cases were evaluated by a Nurse Practitioner and Neurologist specializing in stroke to determine if the readmission was preventable. Consensus was reached on all cases. Results: The 30-day readmission rate was 7.47% with 48 readmissions in 46 patients. When compared to all ischemic stroke patients, the readmitted patients were younger (mean age 56 yrs vs 68 yrs) with higher LOS (median 8 days vs 4 days) and comparable NIHSS (mean 8.5 vs 8.8). Stroke or TIA accounted for 7 (14.6%) readmissions. Median number of days to readmission was 7.5, with 47.8% of readmissions occurring within 7 days. Case review determined 27 (56.3%) not to be preventable, 8% were questionable. Outpatient evaluation may have prevented 9 (18.8%), 6.3% were felt to be initial coding errors and should have been removed from the original sample; 10.4% (5) reflected care at the hospital level. Conclusions: Based on case reviews at our institution less than half of readmissions are preventable, with only about 10% reflecting aspects of a patient's inpatient care. Categorizing preventable readmissions into administrative, hospital, or outpatient related will assist in development of a plan for readmission reduction. Through collaboration with health information management those patients with unclear coding will be reviewed and revised. Phone calls within 7 days for patients discharged home have increased in regularity. Future planning for participation in Medicare bundled payments for stroke may encourage more collaboration with SNF and Rehabilitation facilities, allowing for evaluation without hospital admission.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>D.N, Pasko</author><author>J.D, Boone</author><author>E.D, Thomas</author><author>W.K, Huh</author><author>R.D, Alvarez</author><author>C.A, Leath I I I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Are hospital readmissions an accurate measure of quality cancer care in gynecologic oncology patients?</title><secondary-title>Gynecologic Oncology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Gynecologic Oncology</full-title></periodical><pages>82</pages><volume>137</volume><keywords><keyword>*female</keyword><keyword>*hospital</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*human</keyword><keyword>*neoplasm</keyword><keyword>*oncology</keyword><keyword>*patient</keyword><keyword>*society</keyword><keyword>abdominal pain</keyword><keyword>body mass</keyword><keyword>chemotherapy</keyword><keyword>data base</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>failure to thrive</keyword><keyword>health care</keyword><keyword>health center</keyword><keyword>intestine obstruction</keyword><keyword>lung disease</keyword><keyword>medicaid</keyword><keyword>medicare</keyword><keyword>nausea and vomiting</keyword><keyword>ovary cancer</keyword><keyword>pelvis abscess</keyword><keyword>physician</keyword><keyword>radiotherapy</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>therapy</keyword><keyword>total quality management</keyword><keyword>university</keyword><keyword>uterine cervix cancer</keyword><keyword>uterus cancer</keyword><keyword>wound complication</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>D.N.

The objective of this study was to evaluate gynecologic oncology (GO) readmission rates and associated factors to identify potentially preventable readmissions. Methods: A retrospective review of the UHC database for GO readmissions at our institution from January 2011 to July 2014 was performed. Abstracted data included patient and disease characteristics and readmissions defined by UHC criteria. Planned admissions for chemotherapy and radiation therapy were excluded. After independent physician review, reasons for readmissions considered potentially preventable included nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, and failure to thrive. Outcome measures were 30-day readmission rates and readmission diagnoses. Results: A total of 3781 GO patients were hospitalized. There were 189 readmissions among 159 patients. The mean age was 55 years and mean body mass index was 28.9; 65.6% of the patients were white. Medicare and Medicaid insured 61.4% of patients. A total of 127 patients had a malignant primary diagnosis; the most common were ovarian cancer (52.8%), cervical cancer (22.8%), and uterine cancer (18.1%). Within 21 days of initial admission, chemotherapy was given to 43.2% of patients with ovarian cancer, and 37.9% of patients with cervical cancer had undergone surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy 21 days prior to initial admission. Twenty six patients had benign disease and three patients had premalignant disease. The most common 30-day readmission diagnoses were wound complications (23.3%), intestinal obstruction (15.9%), pelvic abscess (9.0%), renal abnormalities (7.9%), nausea and vomiting (6.3%), pulmonary disorders (6.3%), abdominal pain (5.3%), and failure to thrive (5.3%). Thirty-eight of 189 (20.1%) readmissions were considered potentially preventable. Conclusions: A minority of patients readmitted to our GO service had potentially preventable conditions. Most factors associated with readmission cannot be modified, which may indicate that readmission rates are not an appropriate measure of quality care. Based on these data, future quality improvement efforts should be directed toward GO patients who have received therapy before admission and have potentially preventable conditions.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>R, Moses</author><author>E, Raffin</author><author>F, Ghali</author><author>M, Menkov</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Can we prevent readmissions following transurethral resection of bladder tumor? a multivariate analysis of a large single institution's experience</title><secondary-title>Journal of Urology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Urology</full-title></periodical><pages>e564-e564</pages><volume>193</volume><issue>4 SUPPL. 1</issue><keywords><keyword>*American</keyword><keyword>*bladder tumor</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*multivariate analysis</keyword><keyword>*transurethral resection</keyword><keyword>ambulatory surgery</keyword><keyword>bivariate analysis</keyword><keyword>cardiovascular disease</keyword><keyword>data base</keyword><keyword>diabetes mellitus</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>follow up</keyword><keyword>gender</keyword><keyword>health care</keyword><keyword>hematuria</keyword><keyword>hospital</keyword><keyword>hospital service</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>insurance</keyword><keyword>invasive procedure</keyword><keyword>kidney disease</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>medical record review</keyword><keyword>obstructive uropathy</keyword><keyword>outpatient</keyword><keyword>patient</keyword><keyword>procedures</keyword><keyword>regression analysis</keyword><keyword>smoking</keyword><keyword>tobacco use</keyword><keyword>tumor volume</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>R.

We sought to investigate factors associated with unplanned 30 day readmission following transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURBT). METHODS: Using a data warehouse query, we reviewed all TURBTs performed at a single academic institution between April 2011 and August 2014. Focused chart review was used to confirm unplanned readmission. We evaluated patient characteristics including age, gender, comorbidities (including asthma/COPD, smoking status, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and renal disease), location of procedure (outpatient surgery center vs. main OR), length of stay (&lt;24 hrs vs. 24+ hrs), tumor size (&lt;0.5cm, &gt;0.5cm but&lt; 2.0cm, &gt; 2.0 cm but &lt;5.0cm, and &gt;5.0cm), referring hospital service area (RHSA) reflecting distance from the hospital, and insurance type. Bivariate analysis and multivariate regression analysis were conducted to determine associated factors. RESULTS: A total of 723 patients were included, 24.2% (175/ 723) female with an average age of 70 (+/-12) yrs. A total of 34 (4.7%, 34/723) patients had an unplanned readmission. The most common genitourinary reasons for readmission included hematuria/clot retention (41%, 14/34), UTI (24%, 8/34), and obstructive uropathy (6%, 2/34). Ten patients (29.4%) were readmitted for medical reasons. Bivariate analysis revealed higher rates of unplanned return with longer index length of stay 24+hrs (26% vs. 10%, p=0.003), cardiovascular disease (71% vs. 53%, p&lt;0.043), and positive smoking status (91% vs. 72%,p=0.014). Although only approaching significance, TURBTs performed at the outpatient center were less likely to be readmitted (6% vs. 22.4%, p=0.061). On multivariate analysis, longer length of stay (24+ hrs) (OR 3.31, CI:1.16-8.45, p=0.024) and smoking (OR 3.97, CI:1.16-13.53, p=0.028) remained independently associated with readmission. CONCLUSIONS: The most common reason for unplanned readmission after TURBT was hematuria. Those who require additional length of stay at the time of index procedure may require additional attention via phone or clinic follow-up to reduce the likelihood of rehospitalization. Interestingly, disease burden was not independently associated with readmission despite requiring a more invasive procedure. The association of tobacco use and readmission requires further elucidation.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>O, Dalleur</author><author>P.E, Beeler</author><author>J.L, Schnipper</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>30-day potentially avoidable readmissions due to adverse drug events in medical patients</title><secondary-title>Journal of General Internal Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of General Internal Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>S83-S84</pages><volume>30</volume><keywords><keyword>*adverse drug reaction</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*human</keyword><keyword>*internal medicine</keyword><keyword>*patient</keyword><keyword>*society</keyword><keyword>acute kidney failure</keyword><keyword>algorithm</keyword><keyword>analgesic agent</keyword><keyword>anticoagulant agent</keyword><keyword>antihypertensive agent</keyword><keyword>antineoplastic agent</keyword><keyword>bleeding</keyword><keyword>case control study</keyword><keyword>dehydration</keyword><keyword>diuretic agent</keyword><keyword>heart failure</keyword><keyword>hospital discharge</keyword><keyword>hypoglycemia</keyword><keyword>hypotension</keyword><keyword>inappropriate prescribing</keyword><keyword>insulin</keyword><keyword>loop diuretic agent</keyword><keyword>medical record</keyword><keyword>mental health</keyword><keyword>nitrogen 13</keyword><keyword>pain</keyword><keyword>physician</keyword><keyword>population</keyword><keyword>random sample</keyword><keyword>risk reduction</keyword><keyword>university hospital</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>O.

However, these events need to be better characterized in order to find the most appropriate risk reduction interventions. The objective of this study was to describe instances of potentially avoidable readmissions due to adverse drug events in a medical population. METHODS: In this nested case control study, we analyzed a random sample of 534 potentially avoidable 30-day readmissions from 10,275 consecutive discharges from the medical department of an academic medical center between July 1, 2009 and June 30, 2010. Potentially avoidable readmissions were determined using the previously validated SQLape algorithm. Medical records were independently reviewed by 9 trained physicians to identify those readmissions due to adverse drug events. Instances of over-prescribing (use of a drug without a valid indication), mis-prescribing (valid indication, but inappropriate duration, dose, choice of active agent, costs, interactions, or route of administration), under-prescribing (lack of a required drug given the previously known conditions of the patient), and other potential causes of adverse drug events were identified. RESULTS: Among 534 cases of 30-day potentially avoidable readmissions reviewed, 80 (15%) were partially or predominantly due to an adverse drug event. The drug classes that were the most frequently involved were: antineoplastic agents (n=14, 18 %), loop diuretics (n=13, 16 %), analgesics (n=11, 14 %), antibacterials for systemic use (n=8, 10 %) and antithrombotic agents (n=7, 9 %). Over-prescribing of drugs occurred in 9 % (n=7) of cases, mainly due to altered mental status on analgesics (n=3) and dehydration on diuretics (n=2). Mis-prescribing was identified in 24%(n=19) of cases, mainly due to hypotension and acute renal failure on diuretics and antihypertensives (n=8), bleeding on overdosed or poorly monitored antithrombotics (n=3) and hypoglycemia on insulin (n= 3). Under-prescribing involved 10%(n=8) of the cases, most notably readmissions due to uncontrolled pain (analgesics, n=3) and volume overload and heart failure (lacking sufficient dosing of diuretics, n=2). The other 45% (n=36) were cases where the adverse drug event was related to other factors, such as compliance issues (n=6). CONCLUSIONS: Common drugs, such as analgesics and diuretics, were frequently involved in over-, mis- or under-prescribing, leading to adverse drug events that contributed to readmissions. Those drugs could be targets for interventions to prevent readmissions.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>A.-L, Blanc</author><author>T, Fumeaux</author><author>M, Carpentier</author><author>A, Ourahmoune</author><author>J, Desmeules</author><author>P, Chopard</author><author>A, Perrier</author><author>N, Schaad</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identification of factors associated with hospital potentially preventable readmission in Switzerland</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Clinical Pharmacy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Clinical Pharmacy</full-title></periodical><pages>181</pages><volume>37</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>*Switzerland</keyword><keyword>*clinical pharmacy</keyword><keyword>*hospital</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*human</keyword><keyword>*patient safety</keyword><keyword>Charlson Comorbidity Index</keyword><keyword>Swiss</keyword><keyword>aldosterone</keyword><keyword>algorithm</keyword><keyword>anemia</keyword><keyword>angiotensin</keyword><keyword>asthma</keyword><keyword>benzodiazepine</keyword><keyword>dementia</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>diseases</keyword><keyword>diuretic agent</keyword><keyword>drug interaction</keyword><keyword>electrolyte</keyword><keyword>general practice</keyword><keyword>glucose blood level</keyword><keyword>heart failure</keyword><keyword>hospital patient</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>hyperkalemia</keyword><keyword>hypernatremia</keyword><keyword>insulin</keyword><keyword>international normalized ratio</keyword><keyword>ischemic heart disease</keyword><keyword>laboratory</keyword><keyword>laboratory diagnosis</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>logistic regression analysis</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>neoplasm</keyword><keyword>nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent</keyword><keyword>patient</keyword><keyword>pharmacist</keyword><keyword>renin</keyword><keyword>retrospective study</keyword><keyword>risk</keyword><keyword>risk factor</keyword><keyword>total quality management</keyword><keyword>university</keyword><keyword>ward</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>A.-L.

Patients at high risk of readmission should be identified early during their hospital stay, in order to benefit from specific interventions to prevent these readmissions. The aim of the present study was to characterize the profile of patients readmitted in Swiss hospitals. Setting and method: This retrospective study included all patients identified by SQLape (Swiss algorithm used for hospital quality management) readmitted within 30 days in 2011 in general medicine wards of two different Swiss hospitals (university and regional). Control patients were matched on age and sex. To identify factors associated with PPR, multivariate logistic regressions were performed on 4 pre-set groups of variables: administrative information, admission diagnosis, laboratory values and drugs. Charlson score was analysed out of the diagnosis group. Main outcome measures: Factors associated with PPR. Results: 982 patients (275 readmitted and 707 controls, mean age (SD) 68.9 (16.2) years, 60 %male) were included. The following variables were found to be significantly associated with PPR. Administrative information: previous admission within 6 month (Odds ratio, 95CI: 2.52 (1.88,3.39)), length of stay &gt;14 days (2.45 (1.69,3.55)). Admission diagnosis: cancer (1.77 (1.21,2.58)), heart failure (1.96 (1.40,2.73)), dementia (1.83 (1.08,3.06)), ischemic cardiopathy (2.04 (1.28,3.23)). Charlson comorbidity score &gt;3 (1.45 (1.02,2.06)). Laboratory values: hyperkalaemia (2.67 (1.36,5.31)), hypo-haemoglobinemia (1.48 (1.01,2.14)), spontaneous INR&gt;1.5 (1.52 (1.03,2.22)), last measured creatininemia&gt;120 mmol/L (1.57 (1.04;2.36)). Drugs: diuretics (1.53 (1.10,2.11)), number of severe drug-drug interactions&gt;2 (1.79 (1.24,2.58)). PPR was significantly reduced in presence of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone drugs (0.55 (0.39,0.76)). Electrolyte and acido-basic disorders, anaemia, COPD and asthma, hypernatremia, opioids, blood glucose lowering drugs including insulin, benzodiazepine and NSAID were not associated with PPR. Conclusions: This Swiss retrospective study identified several factors significantly associated with PPR and routinely available during hospital stay that might help to identify patients at risk of PPR. These preliminary results will be the basis for the development of a predictive tool that could further be used by clinical pharmacists to target their interventions on specific patients presenting a panel of readmission risk factors.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.T, Le</author><author>S.A, Josephson</author><author>H.A, Puttgen</author><author>C.L, Graf</author><author>H.M, Leicester</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Many neurology readmissions are non-preventable</title><secondary-title>Annals of Neurology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of Neurology</full-title></periodical><pages>S95-S95</pages><volume>78</volume><keywords><keyword>*American</keyword><keyword>*alprazolam</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*neurology</keyword><keyword>biopsy</keyword><keyword>craniotomy</keyword><keyword>hospital</keyword><keyword>hospital patient</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>infusion</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>methodology</keyword><keyword>model</keyword><keyword>patient</keyword><keyword>punishment</keyword><keyword>risk</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>S.T.

Little is known regarding readmission rates for neurology patients, the extent to which readmissions are planned, or factors predicting readmission. Methods: We examined all 5,512 inpatient neurology admissions to UCSF Medical Center and Johns Hopkins Hospital between May 1, 2012 and April 30, 2014. Multivariate logistic modeling was used to examine the impact of age, expected length of stay (eLOS) and observed length of stay (oLOS) on readmission. Results: A total of 391 discharges (7.1%) were readmitted within 30 days. Forty-four of the 311 first instances of readmission (14%) were planned, often for biopsy, elective craniotomies, or infusions. Only 7 of these readmissions would have been classified as planned using national methodology. Multivariate regression revealed that age (OR=1.09 for each ten year increase, p=0.002) and eLOS (OR=1.03, p=0.007) were associated with greater likelihood of readmission. Conclusions: Many neurologic readmissions are planned but would still be penalized using current methodology. Patient age and complexity (eLOS) rather than oLOS are associated with readmission. Our study allows clinicians to focus interventions on those patients at highest risk for readmission.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>A.-L, Blanc</author><author>T, Fumeaux</author><author>J, Stirnemann</author><author>M, Carpentier</author><author>A, Ourahmoune</author><author>J, Desmeules</author><author>P, Chopard</author><author>A, Perrier</author><author>N, Schaad</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hospital potentially avoidable readmission in general internal medicine: Elaboration of a predictive score</title><secondary-title>Praxis</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Praxis</full-title></periodical><pages>25</pages><volume>104</volume><keywords><keyword>*hospital</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*human</keyword><keyword>*internal medicine</keyword><keyword>Swiss</keyword><keyword>algorithm</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>drug interaction</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>general practice</keyword><keyword>heart failure</keyword><keyword>heart infarction</keyword><keyword>hospital discharge</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>hyperkalemia</keyword><keyword>ischemic heart disease</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>logistic regression analysis</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>patient</keyword><keyword>receiver operating characteristic</keyword><keyword>retrospective study</keyword><keyword>risk</keyword><keyword>ward</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>A.-L.

The aim of this study was to characterize patients readmitted in two Swiss hospitals, with a specific focus on medication profile, in order to create a predictive tool of hospital potentially avoidable readmissions. Method: This retrospective study included all patients identified by SQLape algorithm as readmitted within 30 days in 2011 in general medicine wards in HUG and GHOL. Control patients, not identified by SQlape as readmitted, were matched on age and sex. Factors associated with potentially preventable readmission were identified with a multivariate logistic regression. Variables of interest were demographic data, diagnoses, lab results and medications at hospital discharge. A predictive score was developed using a regression coefficient-based scoring method. Results: 982 patients (275 readmitted and 707 controls, mean age (SD) 68.9 (16.2) years, 60% male) were included. The variables of interest found to be significantly associated with potentially avoidable readmissions in the multivariate logistic regression [adjusted OR (95CI)] were: COPD [1.60(1.02-2,48)], heart failure [2.02(1.41-2.91)], length of stay &gt; 14 days [2.04(1.38-2.99)], malignancy [1.46(1.02-2.06)], myocardial infarction or ischemic cardiopathy [1.72(1.17-2.51)], previous admission within 6 months [2.21(1.63-2.99)], hyperkaliemia [2.47(1.26-4.94)] and RAA drugs [0.50(0.35-0.71)]. Drug classes, numbers of drugs prescribed or drug-drug interactions at hospital discharge were not associated with an increased risk of hospital potentially avoidable readmissions in this study. The calibration and discriminatory power of this score were fair with an area under the ROC curve (Cstatistic) of 0.714. Conclusion: This retrospective study identified several factors significantly associated with potentially avoidable readmissions and routinely available during hospital stay. Based on these results, a predictive score has been developed and a retrospective external validation will be performed in order to confirm these results.

The rate of readmission exceeds patients' baseline rate of hospitalization, and also exceeds the rate after matched non-sepsis hospitalizations. We sought to determine the most common readmission diagnoses after severe sepsis, the extent to which readmissions may be preventable, and if the pattern of readmission diagnoses differs from that of non-sepsis hospitalizations. Methods: We studied participants in the U.S. Health and Retirement Study with linked Medicare claims (1998-2010). Using validated methods, we identified severe sepsis and non-sepsis hospitalizations, then measured 90-day readmissions in each cohort. Using Healthcare Cost &amp; Utilization Project's Clinical Classification Software, we determined the ten most common readmission diagnoses after severe sepsis. We measured rates of &quot;potentially preventable&quot; readmissions using published definitions. We compared rates of all-cause, potentially preventable, and cause-specific hospitalizations between survivors of severe sepsis and non-sepsis hospitalizations using chi-squared tests. Results: We identified 3,494 severe sepsis and 41,524 non-sepsis hospitalizations, of which 2,843 (81.4%) and 40,252 (96.9%) survived to discharge, respectively. In the next 90 days, 43.6% of severe sepsis survivors were re-hospitalized, compared to 35.0% of non-sepsis survivors, p&lt;0.001. The top readmission diagnoses following severe sepsis (Table 1) included several recognized potentially preventable diagnoses: heart failure, pneumonia, exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and urinary infection. Also common were readmissions for sepsis, acute renal failure, and aspiration pneumonitis, diagnoses that could plausibly be prevented or treated early to prevent hospitalization. Patterns of readmission differed in severe sepsis survivors; rates of readmission for sepsis, renal failure, respiratory failure, and aspiration pneumonitis were higher and accounted for a greater proportion of the total readmissions. Potentially preventable hospitalizations-infection (sepsis, pneumonia, urinary tract, and skin or soft tissue), heart failure, COPD exacerbation, acute renal failure, and aspiration pneumonitis-accounted for 40.7% (95% CI: 38.4%-43.1%) of all readmissions after severe sepsis (compared to 26.1% (95% CI: 25.4%-26.8%) following non-sepsis admission, p&lt;0.001), and 18.1% (95% CI: 16.7%-19.5%) of severe sepsis survivors experienced a readmission for one of these diagnoses (compared to 10.2% (95% CI: 9.9%-10.5%) following a non-sepsis admission, p&lt;0.001). Conclusions: Forty percent hospitalizations after severe sepsis occur for diagnoses that may be preventable. A few disease categories account for a relatively large proportion of the hospitalizations after severe sepsis, suggesting the feasibility of tailoring post-discharge interventions to patient's personalized risk for these common post-sepsis diagnoses.

Introduction: Readmissions are an important issue for patients, physicians, payers, and policymakers. The all-cause readmission rate in 2010 was about 19.2% among Medicare beneficiaries costing the US economy approximately 17.5 billion dollars. Some believe the majority of readmissions are preventable and thus, payers should penalize hospitals and providers for readmission. However, root cause analyses of readmissions from the provider perspective have not been performed. It may be unfair to penalize readmissions if the majority is not preventable. Methods: Retrospective review of the electronic medical record was performed on all 30 day readmissions where the index admission was on the acute cardiology service at a single, academic medical center. The population was a total of 152 patients readmitted from 7/1/2013 - 11/16/14. Root cause analysis was performed by two independent physicians and readmissions were deemed 'preventable', 'maybe preventable', or 'not preventable' based on review of the medical record. Disagreements were settled by an additional reviewer and inter-rater agreement was determined by a weighted kappa analysis. Results: Of 152 readmissions, only 32 (21%) were considered 'preventable' or 'maybe preventable'. The reviewers agreed on 81.3% of cases and the weighted kappa was 0.41 indicating moderate agreement. Fifty-nine (59%) of 'preventable' and 'maybe preventable' readmissions were considered medication related and thirty-one (31%) were considered management related. Conclusions: Preventable readmissions account for a small percentage of total readmissions. Payment policies aimed at penalizing readmission are thus, unlikely to improve quality and may disincentivize providers from appropriately readmitting patients for necessary and appropriate medical care. Other mechanisms to reduce health care cost growth such as finding ways to reduce preference-sensitive, low-value medical care would be more appropriate than penalizing providers and hospitals for readmission.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S., Brindle</author><author>P., Krecioch</author><author>T., Shin</author><author>M., Hunsinger</author><author>J., Dove</author><author>W., Strodel</author><author>J., Gabrielsen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Predicting preventable causes after bariatric surgery: A look inside the &quot;black box&quot;</title><secondary-title>Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases</full-title></periodical><pages>S103-S104</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>6 SUPPL. 1</issue><keywords><keyword>*American</keyword><keyword>*bariatric surgery</keyword><keyword>*society</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>computer program</keyword><keyword>dehydration</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>emergency ward</keyword><keyword>follow up</keyword><keyword>health care</keyword><keyword>hospital</keyword><keyword>hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>interpersonal communication</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>multivariate analysis</keyword><keyword>nausea</keyword><keyword>obstruction</keyword><keyword>outpatient</keyword><keyword>patient</keyword><keyword>prevalence</keyword><keyword>reoperation</keyword><keyword>risk</keyword><keyword>sleeve gastrectomy</keyword><keyword>statistical significance</keyword><keyword>stomach bypass</keyword><keyword>surgery</keyword><keyword>vomiting</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>S.

Surgical readmissions are associated with poorer overall clinical outcomes as well as significant financial risks for patients as well as providers. Understanding readmissions is challenging because the definition of a readmission varies nationally, regionally and even locally. Different payers have different criteria for defining readmissions. Given this difficulty, understanding what may be preventable readmissions becomes even more difficult. Recent studies suggest that many bariatric readmissions may be preventable. A study from New York State used proprietary software to calculate the prevalence of preventable readmissions; however, due to the complexity of the software, the specific de finition of a preventable readmission was not outlined in the report. The objective of this study was to define readmissions after bariatric surgery and then to determine the incidence of preventable readmissions as well as identify modifiable factors that might assist in decreasing readmission rates. Methods: This is a retrospective review of all readmitted bariatric patients after an initial Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG) from May 1, 2007 through April 30, 2014. Any patient readmitted to the hospital for any length of stay within 30 days of discharge was defined as a readmission. All admissions to outside facilities within 30 days of surgery were included. An emergency room visit was not considered a readmission and no patient remained in the emergency room for more than 23 hours. Readmissions were first classified as unrelated or related to the initial surgery. A readmission was classified as unrelated if the indication (admission diagnosis) was not associated with a surgical diagnosis or a complication and the patient did not receive direct treatment during the initial stay. Patients were also classified as no readmission (NR), preventable readmission (PR) or non-preventable readmission (NPR). A readmission was considered preventable if improvements in a health care process (i.e. discharge, follow up or outpatient management) could have prevented the readmission. Preoperative demographic factors and comorbidities as well as perioperative factors were analyzed using both univariate and multivariate analysis. Patients with preventable readmissions were compared to those with no readmission and also to those with non-preventable readmissions. Results: A total of 2113 patients underwent either RYGB or LSG during the study period. 96% of patients and all readmitted patients were available for 30 days post-operative analysis. There were no significant differences in age, BMI, or sex for any of the three groups. One hundred and thirteen patients (55%) were readmitted during the study period and 25 were for less than 2 midnights (22%). 84% of readmission for less than 2 midnights were considered PR. Of the total readmitted 60 (53%) were NPR and 53 (47%) were PR. Of the PR 49 (92.5%, p=0.058) were related to the initial surgery. Patients with a readmission indication of nausea, vomiting or dehydration (NVD) were the most likely to have a PR (62.3% v 33.3%, p=0.002). [Table #1] NPR were more likely for those admitted with a major complications (53.3% v 15.1%, p &lt;0.0001), including obstructions and leaks as well as those requiring reoperation (38.3% v 13.2%, p=0.003). Compared to NPR, the time to readmission was one shorter for the PR (6 vs. 7 days respectively, p value 0.5620) and LOS was significantly longer for NPR (4.5 vs. 2 days). Multivariate analysis showed that GERD (p=0.017) and readmission related to initial surgery (p=0.031) were significantly associated with PR. Conclusions: The rate of potentially preventable readmissions in a large, single institution cohort with excellent patient follow up was 47%. Like others, our study showed that nausea, vomiting or dehydration was the most frequent cause of readmission. Patients with NVD were also the most likely to have a PR. As expected, those patients readmitte with a major complication or for reoperation were significantly associated with NPR. Our plan is to further investigate the social and communication factors involved in patients with preventable readmissions to identify interventions that may prevent the need for readmission.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>S.R., Kristensen</author><author>M., Bech</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A roadmap for comparing readmission policies with application to Denmark, England, Germany and the United States</title><secondary-title>Health Policy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Health Policy</full-title></periodical><pages>264-273</pages><volume>119</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>*hospital policy</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>Denmark</keyword><keyword>Germany</keyword><keyword>United Kingdom</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>acute heart infarction</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>chronic obstructive lung disease</keyword><keyword>diagnosis related group</keyword><keyword>health care system</keyword><keyword>heart failure</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>knee arthroplasty</keyword><keyword>medicare</keyword><keyword>organizational structure</keyword><keyword>pneumonia</keyword><keyword>reimbursement</keyword><keyword>risk assessment</keyword><keyword>total hip prosthesis</keyword><keyword>total quality management</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>M.

This paper reviews readmission policies in Denmark, England, Germany and the United States (Medicare system). The suggested roadmap enables researchers and policy makers to systematically compare and analyse readmission policies. We find considerable differences across countries. In Germany, the readmission policy aims to avoid unintended consequences of the introduction of DRG-based payment; it focuses on readmissions of individual patients and hospitals receive only one DRG-based payment for both the initial and the re-admission. In Denmark, England and the US readmission policies aim at quality improvement and focus on readmission rates. In Denmark, readmission rates are publicly reported but payments are not adjusted in relation to readmissions. In England and the US, financial incentives penalise hospitals with readmission rates above a certain benchmark. In England, this benchmark is defined through local clinical review, while it is based on the risk-adjusted national average in the US. At present, not enough evidence exists to give recommendations on the optimal design of readmission policies. The roadmap can be a tool for systematically assessing how elements of other countries' readmission policies can potentially be adopted to improve national policies.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Woo, Emily</author><author>Woo, Emily Jane</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>CORR Insights(®): What Are the 30-day Readmission Rates Across Orthopaedic Subspecialties?</title><secondary-title>Clinical Orthopaedics &amp; Related Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical Orthopaedics &amp; Related Research</full-title></periodical><pages>848-849 2p</pages><volume>474</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><pub-location>Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, US Food and Drug Administration, 10903 New Hampshire Avenue Silver Spring 20993 USA</pub-location><publisher>Springer Science &amp; Business Media B.V.</publisher><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11999-015-4621-2</electronic-resource-num><notes>Accession Number: 112835407.

We performed blinded medical record review on 641 randomly selected readmissions to validate the pre-encounter planned/unplanned hospital designation. We identified the most common discharge diagnoses associated with subsequent 30-day unplanned readmissions.Results: Among 166 994 discharges (hospital A: n = 55 383; hospital B: n = 111 611), the 30-day unplanned readmission rate was 10.3% (hospital A) and 8.7% (hospital B). The hospital designation of &quot;unplanned&quot; was correct in 98% (hospital A) and 96% (hospital B) of readmissions; the designation of &quot;planned&quot; was correct in 86% (hospital A) and 85% (hospital B) of readmissions. The most common discharge diagnoses for which unplanned 30-day readmissions occurred were oncologic conditions (up to 38%) and nonhypertensive congestive heart failure (about 25%), across both institutions.Conclusions: Unplanned readmission rates for pediatrics, using a validated, accurate, pre-encounter designation of &quot;unplanned,&quot; are higher than previously estimated. For some pediatric conditions, unplanned readmission rates are as high as readmission rates reported for adult conditions. Anticipating unplanned readmissions for high-frequency diagnostic groups may help focus efforts to reduce the burden of readmission for families and facilities. Using timing of hospital registration in administrative records is an accurate, widely available, real-time way to distinguish unplanned vs planned pediatric readmissions.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Auerbach, Andrew D</author><author>Kripalani, Sunil</author><author>Vasilevskis, Eduard E</author><author>Sehgal, Neil</author><author>Lindenauer, Peter K</author><author>Metlay, Joshua P</author><author>Fletcher, Grant</author><author>Ruhnke, Gregory W</author><author>Flanders, Scott A</author><author>Kim, Christopher</author><author>Williams, Mark V</author><author>Thomas, Larissa</author><author>Giang, Vernon</author><author>Herzig, Shoshana J</author><author>Patel, Kanan</author><author>Boscardin, W John</author><author>Robinson, Edmondo J</author><author>Schnipper, Jeffrey L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Preventability and Causes of Readmissions in a National Cohort of General Medicine Patients.</title><secondary-title>JAMA internal medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JAMA internal medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>484-493</pages><volume>176</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>26954564</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1001/jamainternmed.2015.7863</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>IMPORTANCE: Readmission penalties have catalyzed efforts to improve care transitions, but few programs have incorporated viewpoints of patients and health care professionals to determine readmission preventability or to prioritize opportunities for care improvement. OBJECTIVES: To determine preventability of readmissions and to use these estimates to prioritize areas for improvement. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: An observational study was conducted of 1000 general medicine patients readmitted within 30 days of discharge to 12 US academic medical centers between April 1, 2012, and March 31, 2013. We surveyed patients and physicians, reviewed documentation, and performed 2-physician case review to determine preventability of and factors contributing to readmission. We used bivariable statistics to compare preventable and nonpreventable readmissions, multivariable models to identify factors associated with potential preventability, and baseline risk factor prevalence and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) to determine the proportion of readmissions affected by individual risk factors. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Likelihood that a readmission could have been prevented. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 1000 patients (median age was 55 years). Of these, 269 (26.9%) were considered potentially preventable. In multivariable models, factors most strongly associated with potential preventability included emergency department decision making regarding the readmission (aOR, 9.13; 95% CI, 5.23-15.95), failure to relay important information to outpatient health care professionals (aOR, 4.19; 95% CI, 2.17-8.09), discharge of patients too soon (aOR, 3.88; 95% CI, 2.44-6.17), and lack of discussions about care goals among patients with serious illnesses (aOR, 3.84; 95% CI, 1.39-10.64). The most common factors associated with potentially preventable readmissions included emergency department decision making (affecting 9.0%; 95% CI, 7.1%-10.3%), inability to keep appointments after discharge (affecting 8.3%; 95% CI, 4.1%-12.0%), premature discharge from the hospital (affecting 8.7%; 95% CI, 5.8%-11.3%), and patient lack of awareness of whom to contact after discharge (affecting 6.2%; 95% CI, 3.5%-8.7%). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Approximately one-quarter of readmissions are potentially preventable when assessed using multiple perspectives. High-priority areas for improvement efforts include improved communication among health care teams and between health care professionals and patients, greater attention to patients' readiness for discharge, enhanced disease monitoring, and better support for patient self-management.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sills, Marion R</author><author>Hall, Matt</author><author>Colvin, Jeffrey D</author><author>Macy, Michelle L</author><author>Cutler, Gretchen J</author><author>Bettenhausen, Jessica L</author><author>Morse, Rustin B</author><author>Auger, Katherine A</author><author>Raphael, Jean L</author><author>Gottlieb, Laura M</author><author>Fieldston, Evan S</author><author>Shah, Samir S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Association of Social Determinants With Children's Hospitals' Preventable Readmissions Performance.</title><secondary-title>JAMA pediatrics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JAMA pediatrics</full-title></periodical><pages>350-358</pages><volume>170</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>26881387</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1001/jamapediatrics.2015.4440</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>IMPORTANCE: Performance-measure risk adjustment is of great interest to hospital  stakeholders who face substantial financial penalties from readmissions pay-for-performance (P4P) measures. Despite evidence of the association between social determinants of health (SDH) and individual patient readmission risk, the effect of risk adjusting for SDH on readmissions P4P penalties to hospitals is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether risk adjustment for commonly available SDH measures affects the readmissions-based P4P penalty status of a national cohort of children's hospitals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Retrospective cohort study of 43 free-standing children's hospitals within the Pediatric Health Information System database in the calendar year 2013. We evaluated hospital discharges from 2013 that met criteria for 3M Health Information Systems' potentially preventable readmissions measure for calendar year 2013. The analysis was conducted from July 2015 to August 2015. EXPOSURES: Two risk-adjustment models: a baseline model adjusted for severity of illness and an SDH-enhanced model that adjusted for severity of illness and the following 4 SDH variables: race, ethnicity, payer, and median household income for the patient's home zip code. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Change in a hospital's potentially preventable readmissions penalty status (ie, change in whether a hospital exceeded the penalty threshold) using an observed-to-expected potentially preventable readmissions ratio of 1.0 as a penalty threshold. RESULTS: For the 179400 hospital discharges from the 43 hospitals meeting inclusion criteria, median (interquartile range [IQR]) hospital-level percentages for the SDH variables were 39.2% nonwhite (n = 71300; IQR, 28.6%-54.6%), 17.9% Hispanic (n = 32060; IQR, 6.7%-37.0%), and 58.7% publicly insured (n = 106116; IQR, 50.4%-67.8%). The hospital median household income for the patient's home zip code was $40674 (IQR, $35912-$46190). When compared with the baseline model, adjustment for SDH resulted in a change in penalty status for 3 hospitals within the 15-day window (2 were no longer above the penalty threshold and 1 was newly penalized) and 5 hospitals within the 30-day window (3 were no longer above the penalty threshold and 2 were newly penalized). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Risk adjustment for SDH changed hospitals' penalty status on a readmissions-based P4P measure. Without adjusting P4P measures for SDH, hospitals may receive penalties partially related to patient SDH factors beyond the quality of hospital care.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stein, Jacob</author><author>Ossman, Paul</author><author>Viera, Anthony</author><author>Moore, Carlton</author><author>Brubaker, Beth Ann</author><author>French, John</author><author>Liles, Edmund Allen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Was This Readmission Preventable?

With the renewed national focus on the cost and quality of health care, readmissions have become a major target for improvement; however, in general, the viewpoints of patients and healthcare providers have not been considered in these discussions. We aimed to compare provider and patient perspectives on the preventability of hospital readmissions. We also aimed to compare the factors that patients and providers perceive as contributing to readmissions.Methods: We conducted descriptive statistics of readmissions using provider chart reviews (N = 213) on all readmissions to the University of North Carolina hospitalist service during a 6-month span. We also performed a qualitative analysis of those provider chart reviews, in addition to interviews with those readmitted patients (n = 23). We compared the percentage of providers versus patients who believed the readmission was preventable, and we explored the factors to which each group attributed the readmission.Results: Providers stated that 30% of the readmissions were preventable, compared with only 13% of patients. Key contributing factors differed between providers and patients. Providers cited medical problems in 45% of readmissions, pain (24%), follow-up problems (22%), substance abuse (20%), and nonadherence (17%). Patients believed nothing could have been done to prevent them in 35% of readmissions, but they also cited medical problems (35%), incomplete diagnosis or treatment (22%), medication issues (17%), and system concerns (13%) as contributing to readmissions.Conclusions: These data suggest that patients and providers view the issue of readmissions differently and highlight potential areas for improvement.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yap, Vanessa</author><author>Mutneja, Rahul</author><author>Metersky, Mark</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Thirty-Day Readmissions After Pneumonia: How Many Are Preventable?</title><secondary-title>Connecticut medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Connecticut medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>147-151</pages><volume>80</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>27169297</accession-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>INTRODUCTION: Pneumonia remains a continuing target for performance measurement and quality improvement. The aim of this analysis was to examine 30-day all-cause readmissions after pneumonia to identify reasons for readmission and potential opportunities for improvement. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was performed on patients readmitted within 30 days after an index pneumonia hospitalization at the University of Connecticut Health Center in 2011. RESULTS: There were 54 readmissions involving 40 patients and only five (12.5%) patients had readmissions that were deemed potentially preventable. Reasons for readmissions were CHF exacerbation (3), malnutrition (1), and pericardial tamponade (1). Of the 49 non-preventable readmissions, 16 were related to pneumonia/bronchitis. Four out of 16 had known aspiration risks, while the rest had comorbidities including cystic fibrosis, COPD, CHF, HIV, and sickle cell disease. Other readmissions were secondary to underlying co-morbid conditions. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that most 30-day readmissions after hospitalization for pneumonia may not be preventable.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Generic">31</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sutherland, Kim</author><author>Marashi-Pour, Sadaf</author><author>Chen, Huei-Yang Tom</author><author>Morgan, Ann</author><author>Levesque, Jean-Frederic</author><author>K., Sutherland</author><author>S., Marashi-Pour</author><author>H.-Y., Chen</author><author>A., Morgan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Recast the debate about preventable readmissions</title><secondary-title>BMJ Quality and Safety</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMJ Quality and Safety</full-title></periodical><pages>386-387</pages><volume>25</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>*clinical indicator</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*risk standardized readmission ratio</keyword><keyword>case mix</keyword><keyword>emergency care</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>intensive care</keyword><keyword>letter</keyword><keyword>medical audit</keyword><keyword>risk assessment</keyword><keyword>total quality management</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><pub-location>K.

Our experience of developing and publicly reporting outcomes in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, suggests that the debate about readmissions should be recast away from ascertaining whether or not a particular hospital readmission was preventable, towards assessing all hospital-level variation in readmission patterns. We agree with the assertion that all-cause readmission rates are less specific and include normally occurring events related to disease progression. They are subject to differences in patient case mix and so are strengthened considerably by the use of clearly defined patient cohorts and appropriate adjustment for patient-level factors. Earlier this year, our organisation published a report using a 30-day risk-standardised readmission ratio (RSRR) indicator for five clinical conditions (acute myocardial infarction, ischaemic stroke, congestive heart failure, pneumonia and hip fracture surgery) and a 60-day RSRR for two surgical procedures (total hip replacement and total knee replacement). The report drew on linked data from hospital records and death registries covering 12 years (July 2000–June 2012) and highlighted outlier hospitals in the state.2</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rico, Florentino</author><author>Liu, Yazhuo</author><author>Martinez, Diego A</author><author>Huang, Shuai</author><author>Zayas-Castro, Jose L</author><author>Fabri, Peter J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Preventable Readmission Risk Factors for Patients With Chronic Conditions.</title><secondary-title>Journal for healthcare quality : official publication of the National Association for Healthcare Quality</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal for healthcare quality : official publication of the National Association for Healthcare Quality</full-title></periodical><pages>127-142</pages><volume>38</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><accession-num>26042761</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1097/01.JHQ.0000462674.09641.72</electronic-resource-num><language>eng</language><urls/><abstract>Evidence indicates that the largest volume of hospital readmissions occurs among  patients with preexisting chronic conditions. Identifying these patients can improve the way hospital care is delivered and prioritize the allocation of interventions. In this retrospective study, we identify factors associated with readmission within 30 days based on claims and administrative data of nine hospitals from 2005 to 2012. We present a data inclusion and exclusion criteria to identify potentially preventable readmissions. Multivariate logistic regression models and a Cox proportional hazards extension are used to estimate the readmission risk for 4 chronic conditions (congestive heart failure [CHF], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], acute myocardial infarction, and type 2 diabetes) and pneumonia, known to be related to high readmission rates. Accumulated number of admissions and discharge disposition were identified to be significant factors across most disease groups. Larger odds of readmission were associated with higher severity index for CHF and COPD patients. Different chronic conditions are associated with different patient and case severity factors, suggesting that further studies in readmission should consider studying conditions separately.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>K.M, Ancy</author><author>Z.I, Almarzooq</author><author>P.A, Patel</author><author>M.E, Unterbrink</author><author>J.B.I, Estil</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Determining preventable readmissions in an urban academic medical center</title><secondary-title>Journal of General Internal Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of General Internal Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>S179-S179</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>2 SUPPL. 1</issue><keywords><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*internal medicine</keyword><keyword>*society</keyword><keyword>*university hospital</keyword><keyword>caregiver</keyword><keyword>data analysis</keyword><keyword>data base</keyword><keyword>disease severity</keyword><keyword>drug therapy</keyword><keyword>emergency ward</keyword><keyword>general practice</keyword><keyword>general practitioner</keyword><keyword>health</keyword><keyword>health care</keyword><keyword>health care personnel</keyword><keyword>health care system</keyword><keyword>hospital</keyword><keyword>hospital discharge</keyword><keyword>hospital patient</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>interview</keyword><keyword>nurse</keyword><keyword>patient</keyword><keyword>patient care</keyword><keyword>patient coding</keyword><keyword>physician</keyword><keyword>primary medical care</keyword><keyword>social psychology</keyword><keyword>social worker</keyword><keyword>teamwork</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><pub-location>K.M.

In a previously completed study, health care providers and caregivers (collectively defined as the patient care circle) identified several issues (minor themes) contributing to readmissions on the general medicine service that we classified into five major themes: healthcare teamwork (T), illness severity and health needs (I), medication-related issues (M), psychosocial stability (P) and health systems management support (S). In this phase of our study, our objectives were to measure (1) agreement within the patient care circle (PCC) on the themes contributing to readmissions of general medicine patients and (2) perception on whether contributing themes were preventable. METHODS: General medicine patients with same-site 30-day readmissions were randomly identified through a centralized database programmed to flag patients at the time of their readmission. Each patient was used to define one PCC and we identified all relevant members (family member or other primary care giver, floor nurses, emergency department physicians, inpatient attendings, primary care physicians and social workers) to complete the PCC for each patient included in the study. The survey was designed to assess each respondent's agreement about themes contributing to the readmission of a specific patient and contained 27 statements. Each survey statement represented a minor theme identified in our earlier study and was coded to correspond to one of the five major themes. Patients and family member/care givers were asked if the issues (1) affected the patient's prior hospitalization and (2) how strongly they perceived it contributed to the readmission. Providers were asked if the issues (1) contributed to the patient's readmission and (2) were preventable. During the pilot (June-December 2015) we interviewed 12 patients as well as members of their respective PCCs. All providers were combined for provider data analysis. Data were included for only those care circles that included at least one provider interview resulting in ten PCCs included in the final analysis (10 patient surveys and 29 provider surveys). Patient data were analyzed by ranking frequency of agreement for each survey item. The percentage of those reporting they felt an issue contributed to the patient's readmission was determined for each item. Provider responses were clustered by PCC. If at least one provider identified an issue as either (1) a problem or (2) preventable, the responses were reported as identified by the PCC. RESULTS: The highest reported issue associated with readmission by both patients and care circles was within the theme of illness severity-patients felt unable to manage their medical problems at home and were more comfortable returning to the hospital. Seven patients (70 %, CI 42-98 %) agreed with this statement and six of these seven patients (86 %, CI 60-100 %) felt it contributed to their readmission. In addition, eight PCCs (80 %, CI 55-100 %) had at least one provider identify this as a problem but only two of these eight believed it was preventable (25 %, CI 15-55 %). CONCLUSIONS: Our study was designed to help identify the estimated importance and preventability of previously identified major and minor themes contributing to readmissions. Agreement was noted on only one of the top five issues identified by both patients and providers. Issues relevant to patients focused on the transition period and lack of resources to navigate the healthcare system, supporting the need for further understanding of barriers faced after hospital discharge.

OBJECTIVES: (1) Examine the efficiency and reliability of a Web-based fault tree tool designed to guide physicians through chart reviews to a determination about preventability. (2) Investigate root causes of general pediatrics readmissions and identify the percent that are preventable. DESIGN/SETTING/PATIENTS: General pediatricians from The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia used a Web-based fault tree tool to classify root causes of all general pediatrics 15-day readmissions in 2014. INTERVENTION/MEASUREMENTS: The tool guided reviewers through a logical progression of questions, which resulted in 1 of 18 root causes of readmission, 8 of which were considered potentially preventable. Twenty percent of cases were cross-checked to measure inter-rater reliability. RESULTS: Of the 7252 discharges, 248 were readmitted, for an all-cause general pediatrics 15-day readmission rate of 3.4%. Of those readmissions, 15 (6.0%) were deemed potentially preventable, corresponding to 0.2% of total discharges. The most common cause of potentially preventable readmissions was premature discharge. For the 50 cross-checked cases, both reviews resulted in the same root cause for 44 (86%) of files (kappa = 0.79; 95% confidence interval: 0.60-0.98). Completing 1 review using the tool took approximately 20 minutes. CONCLUSION: The Web-based fault tree tool helped physicians to identify root causes of hospital readmissions and classify them as either preventable or not preventable in an efficient and consistent way. It also confirmed that only a small percentage of general pediatrics 15-day readmissions are potentially preventable.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>K.S, Fluitman</author><author>L.S, Van Galen</author><author>H, Merten</author><author>S.M, Rombach</author><author>M, Brabrand</author><author>T, Cooksley</author><author>C.H, Nickel</author><author>C.P, Subbe</author><author>M.H.H, Kramer</author><author>Nanayakkara, P W B A O Nanayakkara P W B</author><author>Orcid: http://orcid.org, Cooksley T</author><author>http://orcid.org, Orcid</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Exploring the preventable causes of unplanned readmissions using root cause analysis: Coordination of care is the weakest link</title><secondary-title>European Journal of Internal Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European Journal of Internal Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>18-24</pages><volume>30</volume><keywords><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*root cause analysis</keyword><keyword>Netherlands</keyword><keyword>adult</keyword><keyword>aged</keyword><keyword>angioneurotic edema</keyword><keyword>antibiotic agent/iv [Intravenous Drug Administrati</keyword><keyword>antibiotic agent/po [Oral Drug Administration]</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>clinical article</keyword><keyword>controlled study</keyword><keyword>cross sectional study</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>health care personnel</keyword><keyword>hospital personnel</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>medical record</keyword><keyword>retrospective study</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><pub-location>P.W.B.

Although many studies aiming to analyze the probable causes leading to unplanned readmissions have been performed, an in depth-study analyzing the human (healthcare worker)-, organizational-, technical-, disease- and patient-related causes leading to readmission is still missing. Objective The primary objective of this study was to identify human-, organizational-, technical-, disease- and patient-related causes which contribute to acute readmission within 30 days after discharge using a Root-Cause Analysis Tool called PRISMA-medical. The secondary objective was to evaluate how many of these readmissions were deemed potentially preventable, and to assess which factors contributed to these preventable readmissions in comparison to non-preventable readmissions. Design Cross-sectional retrospective record study. Setting An academic medical center in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Participants Fifty patients aged 18 years and older discharged from an internal medicine department and acutely readmitted within 30 days after discharge. Main outcome measures Root causes of preventable and unpreventable readmissions. Results Most root causes for readmission were disease-related (46%), followed by human (healthcare worker)- (33%) and patient- (15%) related root causes. Half of the readmissions studied were considered to be potentially preventable. Preventable readmissions predominantly had human-related (coordination) failures. Conclusion and relevance Our study suggests that improving human-related (coordinating) factors contributing to a readmission can potentially decrease the number of preventable readmissions.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>N.O, Glebova</author><author>M, Bronsert</author><author>C.W, Hicks</author><author>M.B, Malas</author><author>K.E, Hammermeister</author><author>J.H, Black</author><author>M.R, Nehler</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Contributions of planned readmissions and patient comorbidities to high readmission rates in vascular surgery patients Presented at Plenary Session 6 at the 2015 Vascular Annual Meeting of the Society for Vascular Surgery, Chicago, Ill, June 17-20, 2015</title><secondary-title>Journal of Vascular Surgery</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Vascular Surgery</full-title></periodical><pages>746</pages><volume>63</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>*comorbidity</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*vascular surgery</keyword><keyword>adult</keyword><keyword>aged</keyword><keyword>conference paper</keyword><keyword>data base</keyword><keyword>diabetes mellitus</keyword><keyword>dialysis</keyword><keyword>ear nose throat surgery</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>general surgery</keyword><keyword>gynecologic surgery</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>major clinical study</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>neurosurgery</keyword><keyword>orthopedic surgery</keyword><keyword>plastic surgery</keyword><keyword>priority journal</keyword><keyword>risk assessment</keyword><keyword>surgical patient</keyword><keyword>thorax surgery</keyword><keyword>total quality management</keyword><keyword>urologic surgery</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><pub-location>N.O.

Bivariable and multivariable risk adjustment analyses were performed using patient comorbidities to compare risks of overall and unplanned readmissions in vascular surgery compared with other specialties. Results Among 1,164,421 surgical patients, 86,403 underwent a vascular operation (other specialties included general surgery, 587,829 [51%]; orthopedic surgery, 211,507 [18%]; gynecology, 82,771 [7%]; urology, 62,153 [5%]; neurosurgery, 55,030 [4.7%]; plastic surgery, 32,318 [3%]; otolaryngology, 31,070 [2.6%]; and thoracic surgery, 15,340 [1%]). Incidence of 30-day readmission was 10.2% for vascular and 5.5% for other specialties (P &lt;.0001). Planned readmissions were more frequent for vascular than for other specialties (8.8% vs 5.4%; P &lt;.0001). In unadjusted analysis, vascular patients had significantly greater risk for overall readmission (odds ratio [OR], 1.97; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.93-2.02; P &lt;.0001) and unplanned readmission (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.84-1.93; P &lt;.0001) compared with other specialties. In bivariable analysis, vascular patients were older (67 +/- 13 vs 56 +/- 17 years) and had more comorbidities such as diabetes (31% vs 14%), dialysis dependence (6.3% vs 0.9%), American Society of Anesthesiology class III/IV status (84% vs 41%), and many others (all P &lt;.0001). After risk adjustment for baseline differences between groups, vascular patients had a marginally greater overall risk of readmission compared with other specialties (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07; P &lt;.0001), but the risk of unplanned readmission was not significantly different (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.95-1.01; P =.13). Conclusions Incidence of 30-day readmission after vascular surgery appears high, but after account for planned readmissions and risk adjustment, the risk of unplanned readmission is similar to that in other surgical patients. Thus, the use of readmission rate as a quality measure must account for more frequent planned vascular readmissions and patient-specific differences between vascular surgery and other specialties.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M.R, Sills</author><author>M, Hall</author><author>J.D, Colvin</author><author>M.L, Macy</author><author>G.J, Cutler</author><author>J.L, Bettenhausen</author><author>R.B, Morse</author><author>K.A, Auger</author><author>J.L, Raphael</author><author>L.M, Gottlieb</author><author>E.S, Fieldston</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Association of social determinants with children s hospitals preventable readmissions performance</title><secondary-title>JAMA Pediatrics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JAMA Pediatrics</full-title></periodical><pages>350-358</pages><volume>170</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>*child health care</keyword><keyword>*childhood disease</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*social determinants of health</keyword><keyword>African American</keyword><keyword>Asian</keyword><keyword>Caucasian</keyword><keyword>Hispanic</keyword><keyword>adolescent</keyword><keyword>adult</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>asthma</keyword><keyword>bronchiolitis</keyword><keyword>child</keyword><keyword>cohort analysis</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>gastroenteritis</keyword><keyword>hospital discharge</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>income</keyword><keyword>infant</keyword><keyword>major clinical study</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>medical information system</keyword><keyword>multicenter study</keyword><keyword>newborn</keyword><keyword>priority journal</keyword><keyword>retrospective study</keyword><keyword>risk assessment</keyword><keyword>seizure</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><pub-location>M.R.

Despite evidence of the association between social determinants of health (SDH) and individual patient readmission risk, the effect of risk adjusting for SDH on readmissions P4P penalties to hospitals is not well understood. OBJECTIVE To determine whether risk adjustment for commonly available SDH measures affects the readmissions-based P4P penalty status of a national cohort of children s hospitals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective cohort study of 43 free-standing children s hospitals within the Pediatric Health Information System database in the calendar year 2013.We evaluated hospital discharges from 2013 that met criteria for 3MHealth Information Systems potentially preventable readmissions measure for calendar year 2013. The analysis was conducted from July 2015 to August 2015. EXPOSURES Two risk-adjustment models: a baseline model adjusted for severity of illness and an SDH-enhanced model that adjusted for severity of illness and the following 4 SDH variables: race, ethnicity, payer, and median household income for the patient s home zip code. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Change in a hospital s potentially preventable readmissions penalty status (ie, change in whether a hospital exceeded the penalty threshold) using an observed-to-expected potentially preventable readmissions ratio of 1.0 as a penalty threshold. RESULTS For the 179 400 hospital discharges from the 43 hospitals meeting inclusion criteria, median (interquartile range [IQR]) hospital-level percentages for the SDH variables were 39.2%nonwhite (n = 71 300; IQR, 28.6%-54.6%), 17.9%Hispanic (n = 32 060; IQR, 6.7%-37.0%), and 58.7%publicly insured (n = 106 116; IQR, 50.4%-67.8%). The hospital median household income for the patient s home zip code was $40 674 (IQR, $35 912-$46 190). When compared with the baseline model, adjustment for SDH resulted in a change in penalty status for 3 hospitals within the 15-day window (2 were no longer above the penalty threshold and 1 was newly penalized) and 5 hospitals within the 30-day window (3 were no longer above the penalty threshold and 2 were newly penalized). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Risk adjustment for SDH changed hospitals penalty status on a readmissions-based P4P measure. Without adjusting P4P measures for SDH, hospitals may receive penalties partially related to patient SDH factors beyond the quality of hospital care.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>D., Burke</author><author>N., Link</author><author>D., Bails</author><author>Y., Fang</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A taxonomy of seven-day readmissions to an urban teaching hospital</title><secondary-title>Journal of Hospital Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Hospital Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>33-38</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*teaching hospital</keyword><keyword>*urban area</keyword><keyword>adult</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>controlled study</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>hospital admission</keyword><keyword>hospital discharge</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>major clinical study</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>medical record review</keyword><keyword>middle aged</keyword><keyword>priority journal</keyword><keyword>retrospective study</keyword><keyword>substance abuse</keyword><keyword>tertiary care center</keyword><keyword>treatment planning</keyword><keyword>treatment refusal</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year></dates><pub-location>M.P.

OBJECTIVE: To identify specific mechanisms of unplanned readmissions through medical narratives obtained from chart reviews. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: Urban tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: Two hundred seventy patients accounted for 335 unplanned 7-day readmissions between July 2010 and July 2011. MEASUREMENTS: Readmissions were classified into 1 of 5 distinct categories. RESULTS: Readmitted subjects were more likely to have had a longer length of stay during the first admission compared to nonreadmitted patients. Readmissions due to unpredictable/unpreventable complications or unrelated events constituted the highest percentage at 46%. Readmissions due to patient factors such as substance abuse, signing out against medical advice, or nonadherence to the treatment plan constituted 31%. Readmissions designated as preventable accounted for 24%. Among preventable readmissions, the most common cause was incomplete management of the index diagnosis. The interobserver level of agreement across the 5 major categories was substantial. CONCLUSIONS: We found through detailed chart review of patients readmitted within 7 days to an urban teaching hospital that the majority of readmissions were not avoidable and were often due to unpredictable or unpreventable complications of the primary diagnosis from the index hospitalization or to patient behaviors that contradicted the treatment plan. These results question the value of readmissions as a valid metric of quality and support future interventions in hospital systems to reduce preventable readmissions.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gay, James C</author><author>Agrawal, Rishi</author><author>Auger, Katherine A</author><author>Del Beccaro, Mark A</author><author>Eghtesady, Pirooz</author><author>Fieldston, Evan S</author><author>Golias, Justin</author><author>Hain, Paul D</author><author>McClead, Richard</author><author>Morse, Rustin B</author><author>Neuman, Mark I</author><author>Simon, Harold K</author><author>Tejedor-Sojo, Javier</author><author>Teufel, Ronald J 2nd</author><author>Harris, J Mitchell 2nd</author><author>Shah, Samir S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rates and impact of potentially preventable readmissions at children's hospitals</title><secondary-title>Journal of Pediatrics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Pediatrics</full-title></periodical><pages>613-619</pages><volume>166</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Emergencies</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Population Surveillance</keyword><keyword>Postoperative Complications</keyword><keyword>Tonsillectomy</keyword><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>J.C.

STUDY DESIGN: A total of 1 719 617 hospitalizations for 1 531 828 unique patients in 58 children's hospitals from 2009 to 2011 from the Children's Hospital Association Case-Mix Comparative database were examined. Main outcome measures included rates, diagnoses, and costs of potentially preventable readmissions (PPRs) and all-cause readmissions. RESULTS: The 7-, 15-, and 30-day rates by 3M-PPRs were 2.5%, 4.1%, and 6.2%, respectively. Corresponding all-cause readmission rates were 5.0%, 8.7%, and 13.3%. At 30 days, 60.6% of all-cause readmissions were considered nonpreventable by 3M-PPRs, more than one-half of which were related to malignancies. The percentage of readmissions rated as potentially preventable was similar at all 3 time intervals. Readmissions after chemotherapy, acute leukemia, and cystic fibrosis were all considered nonpreventable, and at least 80% of readmissions after index admissions for sickle cell crisis, bronchiolitis, ventricular shunt procedures, asthma, and appendectomy were designated potentially preventable. Total costs for all readmissions were $1.7 billion; PPRs accounted for 27.3% of these costs. The most costly readmissions were associated with ventricular shunt procedures ($26.5 million/year), seizures ($15.5 million/year), and sickle cell crisis ($15.0 million/year). CONCLUSIONS: Rates of PPRs were significantly lower than all-cause readmission rates more than one-half of which were caused by exclusion of malignancies. Annual costs of PPRs, although significant in the aggregate, appear to represent a much smaller cost-savings opportunity for children than for adults. Our study may help guide children's hospitals to focus readmission reduction strategies on areas where the financial vulnerability is greatest based on 3M-PPRs.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rosen, Amy K</author><author>Chen, Qi</author><author>Shin, Marlena H</author><author>O'Brien, William</author><author>Shwartz, Michael</author><author>Mull, Hillary J</author><author>Cevasco, Marisa</author><author>Borzecki, Ann M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Medical and surgical readmissions in the Veterans Health Administration: what proportion are related to the index hospitalization?</title><secondary-title>Medical care</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Medical care</full-title></periodical><pages>243-249</pages><volume>52</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>*government</keyword><keyword>*health care quality</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*veterans health</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Comorbidity</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Health Care</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Length of Stay</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Middle Aged</keyword><keyword>Patient Discharge</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Quality Indicators</keyword><keyword>Quality of Health Care</keyword><keyword>Socioeconomic Factors</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>United States Department of Veterans Affairs</keyword><keyword>adult</keyword><keyword>aged</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>chronic obstructive lung disease</keyword><keyword>comorbidity</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>health care quality</keyword><keyword>hospital discharge</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>major clinical study</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>medical care</keyword><keyword>middle aged</keyword><keyword>outcome assessment</keyword><keyword>outcome variable</keyword><keyword>postoperative complication/co [Complication]</keyword><keyword>priority journal</keyword><keyword>socioeconomics</keyword><keyword>statistics</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>total quality management</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><pub-location>A.K.

However, the extent to which medical or surgical readmissions reflect quality of care is largely unknown, because of the complexity of factors related to readmission. Identifying those readmissions that are clinically related to the index hospitalization is an important first step in closing this knowledge gap. OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to examine unplanned readmissions in the Veterans Health Administration, identify clinically related versus unrelated unplanned readmissions, and compare the leading reasons for unplanned readmission between medical and surgical discharges. METHODS: We classified 2,069,804 Veterans Health Administration hospital discharges (Fiscal Years 2003-2007) into medical/surgical index discharges with/without readmissions per their diagnosis-related groups. Our outcome variable was &quot;all-cause&quot; 30-day unplanned readmission. We compared medical and surgical unplanned readmissions (n=217,767) on demographics, clinical characteristics, and readmission reasons using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Among all unplanned readmissions, 41.5% were identified as clinically related. Not surprisingly, heart failure (10.2%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (6.5%) were the top 2 reasons for clinically related readmissions among medical discharges; postoperative complications (ie, complications of surgical procedures and medical care or complications of devices) accounted for 70.5% of clinically related readmissions among surgical discharges. CONCLUSIONS: Although almost 42% of unplanned readmissions were identified as clinically related, the majority of unplanned readmissions were unrelated to the index hospitalization. Quality improvement interventions targeted at processes of care associated with the index hospitalization are likely to be most effective in reducing clinically related readmissions. It is less clear how to reduce nonclinically related readmissions; these may involve broader factors than inpatient care.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Davies, Sheryl</author><author>Saynina, Olga</author><author>Schultz, Ellen</author><author>McDonald, Kathryn M</author><author>Baker, Laurence C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Implications of metric choice for common applications of readmission metrics</title><secondary-title>Health Services Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Health Services Research</full-title></periodical><pages>1978-1995</pages><volume>48</volume><issue>6 PART1</issue><keywords><keyword>Benchmarking</keyword><keyword>California</keyword><keyword>Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (U.S.)</keyword><keyword>Heart Failure</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Myocardial Infarction</keyword><keyword>Patient Discharge</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Pneumonia</keyword><keyword>Quality of Health Care</keyword><keyword>Risk Adjustment</keyword><keyword>United States</keyword><keyword>methods</keyword><keyword>organization &amp; administration</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>therapy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year></dates><pub-location>S.

DATA SOURCES: 2000-2009 California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development Patient Discharge Data Nonpublic file. STUDY DESIGN: We calculated 30-day readmission rates using three metrics, for three disease groups: heart failure (HF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and pneumonia. Using each metric, we calculated the absolute change and correlation between performance; the percent of hospitals remaining in extreme deciles and level of agreement; and differences in longitudinal performance. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Average hospital rates for HF patients and the CMS metric were generally higher than for other conditions and metrics. Correlations between the ACR and CMS metrics were highest (r = 0.67-0.84). Rates calculated using the PPR and either ACR or CMS metrics were moderately correlated (r = 0.50-0.67). Between 47 and 75 percent of hospitals in an extreme decile according to one metric remained when using a different metric. Correlations among metrics were modest when measuring hospital longitudinal change. CONCLUSIONS: Different approaches to computing readmissions can produce different hospital rankings and impact pay-for-performance. Careful consideration should be placed on readmission metric choice for these applications.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sibbritt, D W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Validation of a 28 day interval between discharge and readmission for emergency readmission rates.</title><secondary-title>Journal of quality in clinical practice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of quality in clinical practice</full-title></periodical><pages>211-220 10p</pages><volume>15</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Acute Disease</keyword><keyword>Adult</keyword><keyword>Aged</keyword><keyword>Child</keyword><keyword>Emergency Service</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Health Status Indicators</keyword><keyword>Hospital</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Medicine</keyword><keyword>Models</keyword><keyword>New South Wales</keyword><keyword>Outcome Assessment (Health Care)</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Reproducibility of Results</keyword><keyword>Specialization</keyword><keyword>Theoretical</keyword><keyword>Time Factors</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword><keyword>utilization</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1995</year></dates><pub-location>University of Newcastle, Department of Statistics, Health Services Research Group, Callaghan, NSW 2308, Australia</pub-location><publisher>Wiley-Blackwell</publisher><accession-num>8719060</accession-num><notes>From Duplicate 2 (Validation of a 28 day interval between discharge and readmission for emergency readmission rates. - Sibbritt, D W)

This time period, however, has rarely been justified clinically or statistically and certainly not in Australia. In examining the patterns of readmissions to NSW public acute hospitals, this study provides statistical support for the use of a 28 day interval for total readmissions.

Little is known about the concordance of these methods. METHODS: We manually reviewed 459 30-day, all-cause readmissions at 18 Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospitals, determining potential preventability through a four-step manual review process that included a chart review tool, interviews with patients, their families, and treating providers, and nurse reviewer and physician evaluation of findings and determination of preventability on a five-point scale. We reassessed the same readmissions with 3 M's Potentially Preventable Readmission (PPR) software. We examined between-method agreement and the specificity and sensitivity of the PPR software using manual review as the reference. RESULTS: Automated classification and manual review respectively identified 78% (358) and 47% (227) of readmissions as potentially preventable. Overall, the methods agreed about the preventability of 56% (258) of readmissions. Using manual review as the reference, the sensitivity of PPR was 85% and specificity was 28%. CONCLUSIONS: Concordance between methods was not high enough to replace manual review with automated classification as the primary method of identifying preventable 30-day, all-cause readmission for quality improvement purposes.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wallace, Sowdhamini S</author><author>Keller, Stacey L</author><author>Falco, Carla N</author><author>Nead, Jennifer A</author><author>Minard, Charles G</author><author>Nag, Pratip K</author><author>Quinonez, Ricardo A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An Examination of Physician-, Caregiver-, and Disease-Related Factors Associated With Readmission From a Pediatric Hospital Medicine Service</title><secondary-title>Hospital pediatrics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hospital pediatrics</full-title></periodical><pages>566-573</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>*caregiver</keyword><keyword>*diagnostic error</keyword><keyword>*medication compliance</keyword><keyword>*pediatrics</keyword><keyword>*statistics and numerical data</keyword><keyword>Adolescent</keyword><keyword>Aftercare</keyword><keyword>Caregivers</keyword><keyword>Child</keyword><keyword>Cohort Studies</keyword><keyword>Communication</keyword><keyword>Diagnostic Errors</keyword><keyword>Disease Progression</keyword><keyword>Failure to Thrive</keyword><keyword>Female</keyword><keyword>Guideline Adherence</keyword><keyword>Humans</keyword><keyword>Infant</keyword><keyword>Lymphadenitis</keyword><keyword>Male</keyword><keyword>Medication Adherence</keyword><keyword>Newborn</keyword><keyword>Patient Readmission</keyword><keyword>Pediatrics</keyword><keyword>Practice Guidelines as Topic</keyword><keyword>Preschool</keyword><keyword>Retrospective Studies</keyword><keyword>adolescent</keyword><keyword>aftercare</keyword><keyword>child</keyword><keyword>cohort analysis</keyword><keyword>disease course</keyword><keyword>failure to thrive</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>infant</keyword><keyword>interpersonal communication</keyword><keyword>lymphadenitis</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>newborn</keyword><keyword>practice guideline</keyword><keyword>preschool child</keyword><keyword>retrospective study</keyword><keyword>statistics &amp; numerical data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><isbn>2154-1663</isbn><accession-num>26526802</accession-num><electronic-resource-num>10.1542/hpeds.2015-0015</electronic-resource-num><notes>From Duplicate 1 (An Examination of Physician-, Caregiver-, and Disease-Related Factors Associated With Readmission From a Pediatric Hospital Medicine Service. - Wallace, Sowdhamini S; Keller, Stacey L; Falco, Carla N; Nead, Jennifer A; Minard, Charles G; Nag, Pratip K; Quinonez, Ricardo A)

We also aimed to describe characteristics of potentially preventable cases and the reliability of classification., METHODS: Retrospective descriptive study from December 2008 through June 2010 in a large academic tertiary care children's hospital in Houston, Texas. Children were included if they were readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge from the pediatric hospital medicine service. Reasons for readmission were grouped into three categories: physician-related, caretaker-related, and disease-related. Readmissions with physician- or caretaker-related reasons were considered potentially preventable., RESULTS: The overall readmission rate was 3.1%, and a total of 204 subjects were included in the analysis. Lymphadenitis and failure to thrive had the highest readmission rates with 21%, and 13%, respectively. Twenty percent (n=41/204) of readmissions were preventable with 24% (n=10/41) being physician-related, 12% (n=5/41) caregiver-related, and 63% (n=26/41) for mixed reasons. When comparing classification of readmissions into preventable status, there was moderate agreement between 2 reviewers (K=0.44, 95% confidence interval: 0.28-0.60). Among patients with preventable readmission, the probability of having had a readmission by 7 days and 15 days was 73% and 78%, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Reliable identification of preventable pediatric readmissions using individual reviewers remains a challenge. Additional studies are needed to develop a reliable approach to identify preventable readmissions and underlying modifiable factors. A focused review of 7-day readmissions and diagnoses with high readmission rates may allow use of fewer resources.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M, Rothwell</author><author>C, Jukka</author><author>E, Lum</author><author>C, Mitchell</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Retrospective analysis of emergency readmissions to rural and regional hospitals</title><secondary-title>Journal of Pharmacy Practice and Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Pharmacy Practice and Research</full-title></periodical><pages>290-294</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>*emergency care</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>aged</keyword><keyword>analgesic agent</keyword><keyword>antibiotic agent</keyword><keyword>antibiotic therapy</keyword><keyword>antithrombocytic agent</keyword><keyword>article</keyword><keyword>cardiovascular agent</keyword><keyword>clinical assessment</keyword><keyword>diuretic agent</keyword><keyword>donepezil</keyword><keyword>drug withdrawal</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>general practitioner</keyword><keyword>health care delivery</keyword><keyword>heparin</keyword><keyword>hospital discharge</keyword><keyword>hospital management</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>human</keyword><keyword>hydroxyurea</keyword><keyword>indapamide</keyword><keyword>insulin</keyword><keyword>insulin treatment</keyword><keyword>iron</keyword><keyword>major clinical study</keyword><keyword>male</keyword><keyword>medical information</keyword><keyword>medication therapy management</keyword><keyword>patient compliance</keyword><keyword>patient monitoring</keyword><keyword>pharmacist</keyword><keyword>regionalization</keyword><keyword>retrospective study</keyword><keyword>rural area</keyword><keyword>temazepam</keyword><keyword>treatment outcome</keyword><keyword>verapamil</keyword><keyword>warfarin</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><pub-location>M.

Missing medication information at discharge was identified as a contributor to hospital readmissions. Aim: To identify unplanned readmissions within 28 days of hospital discharge attributable to medications; to assess preventability; and in the medication-related readmissions to identify the medication management information supplied to the GP on initial discharge and whether these patients were seen by a pharmacist during the initial stay and readmission. Method: Records were analysed of patients who had an unplanned readmission within 28 days of discharge, aged 65 years and over, and on 3 or more medications at the time of discharge. A documented method developed for measuring causality, preventability and contribution of medications to the readmission was utilised. Results: 170 patients from 1 regional and 2 rural hospitals were included in the analysis. 39 (23%) readmissions were medication related and 34 (87%) of these were preventable. Dominant reasons for readmission were inadequate communication/monitoring (41%) and inappropriate/suboptimal pharmacological therapy at discharge (62%). Conclusion: Gaps in communicating medication management information across the hospital-community interface continue to contribute to avoidable unplanned readmissions.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>R, Chang</author><author>S, Nichani</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Readmissions-the same old thing?</title><secondary-title>Journal of Hospital Medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Hospital Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>S102</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>4 SUPPL. 2</issue><keywords><keyword>*hospital</keyword><keyword>clinical assessment</keyword><keyword>data base</keyword><keyword>diagnosis related group</keyword><keyword>electronic medical record</keyword><keyword>general practice</keyword><keyword>hospital patient</keyword><keyword>hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>imaging</keyword><keyword>kappa statistics</keyword><keyword>laboratory</keyword><keyword>length of stay</keyword><keyword>medical record review</keyword><keyword>patient</keyword><keyword>patient identification</keyword><keyword>sample size</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year></dates><pub-location>R.

It is believed that many patients are readmitted because of a recurrence or worsening of the same condition for which they were originally hospitalized. Such readmissions might be preventable if related to inadequate treatment or poor care transitions. However, the degree to which patient readmissions occur for the same reason remains uncertain, as most studies thus far have relied on administrative data. Purpose: To determine (1) the accuracy of billing data compared with clinical chart review in determining the reason for readmissions and (2) whether patients were readmitted for the same reason as the original admission based on clinical assessment. Description: All patients who were readmitted in November 2009 within 30 days of their discharge from the inpatient general medicine service were included. Sixty-seven unique patients were identified. Administrative data regarding patient identification, reason for initial and subsequent admissions, demographic data, and length of stay were obtained. Only the first readmission was evaluated if more than 1 readmission occurred. Data elements in the chart review of the electronic medical record included discharge summaries, laboratory data, radiographic imaging, and inpatient progress notes from the primary and consulting services. Two reviewers evaluated the data independently looking at (1) the primary reasons (up to 4) for initial admission, (2) primary reasons for readmission, (3) whether these reasons matched the primary billing diagnosis- related group (DRG) code listed for admission and readmission, and (4) categorizing the readmission into 1 of 4 nominal categories: same-planned, same-unplanned, different- planned, and different-unplanned. Cohen's kappa coefficient was used to calculate the degree of interrater agreement. The reasons for both admission and readmission in the administrative billing record matched the findings of the clinical reviewers in only 34 cases (51%). Only 8 readmissions (12%) were planned. Of the unplanned readmissions, 31 patients (46%) were readmitted for the same reasons and 28 (42%) for different reasons from their index hospitalization. The K coefficien t was 0.63 between observers. Conclusions: The majority of patients in this sample were readmitted in an unplanned fashion. Of these, only half were for reasons similar to their index hospitalization. Moreover, discrepancies in the reason for admission between billing DRG and clinical chart review were found in a substantial number of patients, highlighting the limited accuracy of using administrative databases for this purpose. These results are limited by sample size, single-center experience, and the retrospective nature of the study.</abstract></record><record><database name="Blanca Citations.enl" path="Blanca Citations.enl">Blanca Citations.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>M, Subramanian Souphis Subramanian Souphis</author><author>R, Sylvester</author><author>A, Wiles</author><author>M, Subramanian Souphis Subramanian Souphis</author><author>W, Froehlich</author><author>L, Gordon</author><author>T, Alexandris-Souphis</author><author>E, Kline-Rogers</author><author>P, Vaishnava</author><author>M, Rubenfire</author><author>M., Souphis Subramanian</author><author>R., Sylvester</author><author>A., Wiles</author><author>M., Souphis Subramanian</author><author>W., Froehlich</author><author>L., Gordon</author><author>T., Alexandris-Souphis</author><author>E., Kline-Rogers</author><author>P., Vaishnava</author><author>M., Rubenfire</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Readmission avoidability in acute coronary syndrome patients</title><secondary-title>Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes</full-title></periodical><pages>no pagination-no pagination</pages><volume>7</volume><keywords><keyword>*acute coronary syndrome</keyword><keyword>*hospital readmission</keyword><keyword>*human</keyword><keyword>*medical society</keyword><keyword>*outcomes research</keyword><keyword>*patient</keyword><keyword>adverse drug reaction</keyword><keyword>cardiac patient</keyword><keyword>cardiologist</keyword><keyword>consensus</keyword><keyword>diagnosis</keyword><keyword>disease course</keyword><keyword>emergency care</keyword><keyword>female</keyword><keyword>hospital</keyword><keyword>hospitalization</keyword><keyword>medicare</keyword><keyword>neoplasm</keyword><keyword>population</keyword><keyword>thorax pain</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year></dates><pub-location>M.

According to Medicare 13.4% of AMI admissions were followed by a rehospitalization within 15 days. A 2007 MedPAC report declared 76% of 30-day readmissions preventable. These rates are used as quality indicators despite lack of consensus on the definition of avoidable and unavoidable readmissions. We sought to define these terms and to analyze the effect of these definitions on 30-day outcomes. Methods: BRIDGE (Bridging the Discharge Gap Effectively) is an NP-led transitional care program for cardiac patients within 14 days of discharge. Retrospective data were abstracted on ACS patients readmitted before their appointments between 2008-2010. All readmissions were characterized as avoidable or unavoidable. Definitions were developed from the literature and in concert with senior cardiologists. Avoidable readmission was defined as being the result of a patient or provider issue that if managed may have prevented the admission. Unavoidable readmissions were defined as a patient in need of acute care. Avoidability status was further divided as related or unrelated to the index diagnosis. Results: Of 1188 BRIDGE referrals 304 (25.6%) experienced ACS events. In comparison to the total ACS population, patients readmitted before their BRIDGE clinic appointment (BC) (n=21, 6.9%) tended to be older, female, and were less likely to have a history of a cath or AMI (Table 1). In this study, 81% (n=17) of early readmissions were deemed unavoidable and most (n=14, 66.7%) were attributed to non-ACS issues or disease progression. These unavoidable readmissions included patients with cancer complications, chest pain, or other non-related diagnoses. Only 19% (n=4) of the readmissions were declared avoidable as a result of patient lack of adherence or provider issues such as adverse drug effects. Conclusion: The majority of early (before BC) readmissions following an index hospitalization for ACS patients referred to BRIDGE were unavoidable and unrelated to ACS. A clear discrepancy is seen between the 76% preventable readmissions in the MedPAC report and the 19% preventable readmissions in this study. Distinctions between unavoidable and avoidable readmissions should inform the utility of 30-day readmission rates as quality metrics.</abstract></record></records></xml>
